Pleasure without conscience. Knowledge without character. Commerce without morality. Science without humanity. Worship without sacrifice. Politics without principle.From a sermon given by Frederick Lewis Donaldson in Westminster Abbey, London, on March 20, 1925.Never memorize something that you can look up.One, remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Two, never give up work. Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it. Three, if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is there and don\\'t throw it away.If we knew what it was we were doing, it would not be called research, would it?Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day.—\"Old Man\\'s Advice to Youth: \\'Never Lose a Holy Curiosity.\\'\" LIFE Magazine (2 May 1955) p. 64The fact that we live at the bottom of a deep gravity well, on the surface of a gas covered planet going around a nuclear fireball 90 million miles away and think this to be normal is obviously some indication of how skewed our perspective tends to be.The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science.Time is a drug. Too much of it kills you.An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field.I\\'m sure the universe is full of intelligent life. It\\'s just been too intelligent to come here.We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special.Science and religion are not at odds. Science is simply too young to understand.In the beginning there was nothing, which exploded.That which can be asserted without evidence, can be dismissed without evidence.Though my soul may set in darkness, it will rise in perfect light; I have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night.Everything must be made as simple as possible. But not simpler.A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life.The good thing about science is that it\\'s true whether or not you believe in it.Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard, are sweeterFor me, I am driven by two main philosophies: know more today about the world than I knew yesterday and lessen the suffering of others. You\\'d be surprised how far that gets you.Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality.Your assumptions are your windows on the world. Scrub them off every once in a while, or the light won\\'t come in.Space is big. You just won\\'t believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it\\'s a long way down the road to the chemist\\'s, but that\\'s just peanuts to space.If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.A thinker sees his own actions as experiments and questions--as attempts to find out something. Success and failure are for him answers above all.It would be possible to describe everything scientifically, but it would make no sense; it would be without meaning, as if you described a Beethoven symphony as a variation of wave pressure.We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here.We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds, how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred?Life would be tragic if it weren\\'t funny.For me, it is far better to grasp the Universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring.Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.You never change things by fighting the existing reality.To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.Physics is like sex: sure, it may give some practical results, but that\\'s not why we do it.Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.I believe there is another world waiting for us. A better world. And I\\'ll be waiting for you there.So this is it,\" said Arthur, \"We are going to die.\"\"Yes,\" said Ford, \"except... no! Wait a minute!\" He suddenly lunged across the chamber at something behind Arthur\\'s line of vision. \"What\\'s this switch?\" he cried.\"What? Where?\" cried Arthur, twisting round.\"No, I was only fooling,\" said Ford, \"we are going to die after all.Who is more humble? The scientist who looks at the universe with an open mind and accepts whatever the universe has to teach us, or somebody who says everything in this book must be considered the literal truth and never mind the fallibility of all the human beings involved?I can see how it might be possible for a man to look down upon the earth and be an atheist, but I cannot conceive how a man could look up into the heavens and say there is no God.In my opinion, we don\\'t devote nearly enough scientific research to finding a cure for jerks.Do you know what we call opinion in the absence of evidence? We call it prejudice.If you try and take a cat apart to see how it works, the first thing you have on your hands is a non-working cat.Wisdom is not a product of schooling but of the lifelong attempt to acquire it.We are an impossibility in an impossible universe.In science it often happens that scientists say, \\'You know that\\'s a really good argument; my position is mistaken,\\' and then they would actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again. They really do it. It doesn\\'t happen as often as it should, because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful. But it happens every day. I cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or religion.For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable – what then?I have a friend who\\'s an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don\\'t agree with very well. He\\'ll hold up a flower and say \"look how beautiful it is,\" and I\\'ll agree. Then he says \"I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing,\" and I think that he\\'s kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it\\'s not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there\\'s also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don\\'t understand how it subtracts.Beware the irrational, however seductive. Shun the \\'transcendent\\' and all who invite you to subordinate or annihilate yourself. Distrust compassion; prefer dignity for yourself and others. Don\\'t be afraid to be thought arrogant or selfish. Picture all experts as if they were mammals. Never be a spectator of unfairness or stupidity. Seek out argument and disputation for their own sake; the grave will supply plenty of time for silence. Suspect your own motives, and all excuses. Do not live for others any more than you would expect others to live for you.God does not play dice with the universe.Science investigates; religion interprets. Science gives man knowledge, which is power; religion gives man wisdom, which is control. Science deals mainly with facts; religion deals mainly with values. The two are not rivals.I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is at all comprehensible.Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light‐years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual. So are our emotions in the presence of great art or music or literature, or acts of exemplary selfless courage such as those of Mohandas Gandhi or Martin Luther King, Jr. The notion that science and spirituality are somehow mutually exclusive does a disservice to both.Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking.The problem, often not discovered until late in life, is that when you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. For me, I am driven by two main philosophies, know more today about the world than I knew yesterday. And lessen the suffering of others. You\\'d be surprised how far that gets you.I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use.I like the scientific spirit—the holding off, the being sure but not too sure, the willingness to surrender ideas when the evidence is against them: this is ultimately fine—it always keeps the way beyond open—always gives life, thought, affection, the whole man, a chance to try over again after a mistake—after a wrong guess.I am an atheist, out and out. It took me a long time to say it. I\\'ve been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn\\'t have. Somehow, it was better to say one was a humanist or an agnostic. I finally decided that I\\'m a creature of emotion as well as of reason. Emotionally, I am an atheist. I don\\'t have the evidence to prove that God doesn\\'t exist, but I so strongly suspect he doesn\\'t that I don\\'t want to waste my time.We are stuck with technology when what we really want is just stuff that works.I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.Student: Dr. Einstein, Aren\\'t these the same questions as last year\\'s [physics] final exam?Dr. Einstein: Yes; But this year the answers are different.Every atom in your body came from a star that exploded. And, the atoms in your left hand probably came from a different star than your right hand. It really is the most poetic thing I know about physics: You are all stardust. You couldn’t be here if stars hadn’t exploded, because the elements - the carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, all the things that matter for evolution and for life - weren’t created at the beginning of time. They were created in the nuclear furnaces of stars, and the only way for them to get into your body is if those stars were kind enough to explode. So, forget Jesus. The stars died so that you could be here today.Whether or not you believe in God, you must believe this: when we as a species abandon our trust in a power greater than us, we abandon our sense of accountability. Faiths… all faiths… are admonitions that there is something we cannot understand, something to which we are accountable. With faith we are accountable to each other, to ourselves, and to a higher truth. Religion is flawed, but only because man is flawed. The church consists of a brotherhood of imperfect, simple souls wanting only to be a voice of compassion in a world spinning out of control.We can judge our progress by the courage of our questions and the depth of our answers, our willingness to embrace what is true rather than what feels good.Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations. What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe? The usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe. Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?You will be required to do wrong no matter where you go. It is the basic condition of life, to be required to violate your own identity. At some time, every creature which lives must do so. It is the ultimate shadow, the defeat of creation; this is the curse at work, the curse that feeds on all life. Everywhere in the universe.From the standpoint of daily life, however, there is one thing we do know: that we are here for the sake of each other - above all for those upon whose smile and well-being our own happiness depends, and also for the countless unknown souls with whose fate we are connected by a bond of sympathy. Many times a day I realize how much my own outer and inner life is built upon the labors of my fellow men, both living and dead, and how earnestly I must exert myself in order to give in return as much as I have received.Scientists have calculated that the chances of something so patently absurd actually existing are millions to one.But magicians have calculated that million-to-one chances crop up nine times out of ten.A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth. Authoritarian institutions and marketers have always known this fact.Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it is those who know little, not those who know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science.I don\\'t accept the currently fashionable assertion that any view is automatically as worthy of respect as any equal and opposite view. My view is that the moon is made of rock. If someone says to me \\'Well, you haven\\'t been there, have you? You haven\\'t seen it for yourself, so my view that it is made of Norwegian Beaver Cheese is equally valid\\' - then I can\\'t even be bothered to argue. There is such a thing as the burden of proof, and in the case of god, as in the case of the composition of the moon, this has shifted radically. God used to be the best explanation we\\'d got, and we\\'ve now got vastly better ones. God is no longer an explanation of anything, but has instead become something that would itself need an insurmountable amount of explaining. So I don\\'t think that being convinced that there is no god is as irrational or arrogant a point of view as belief that there is. I don\\'t think the matter calls for even-handedness at all.The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.For millions of years, mankind lived just like the animals. Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination. We learned to talk and we learned to listen. Speech has allowed the communication of ideas, enabling human beings to work together to build the impossible. Mankind\\'s greatest achievements have come about by talking, and its greatest failures by not talking. It doesn\\'t have to be like this. Our greatest hopes could become reality in the future. With the technology at our disposal, the possibilities are unbounded. All we need to do is make sure we keep talking.I don\\'t want to believe. I want to know.The scientist is not a person who gives the right answers, he\\'s one who asks the right questions.Science is organized knowledge. Wisdom is organized life.I\\'m a pessimist because of intelligence, but an optimist because of will.I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.The opposite of a correct statement is a false statement. But the opposite of a profound truth may well be another profound truth.How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property – either as a child, a wife, or a concubine – must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith: all know how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome.We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.Science, my lad, is made up of mistakes, but they are mistakes which it is useful to make, because they lead little by little to the truth.Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.The so-called paradox of freedom is the argument that freedom in the sense of absence of any constraining control must lead to very great restraint, since it makes the bully free to enslave the meek. The idea is, in a slightly different form, and with very different tendency, clearly expressed in Plato.Less well known is the paradox of tolerance: Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. — In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents... some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new Dark Age.Science is interesting, and if you don\\'t agree you can fuck off.Note: Dawkins was quoting a former editor of New Scientist Magazine, who is as yet unidentified (possibly Jeremy Webb)If there is any religion that could respond to the needs of modern science, it would be Buddhism.When we read, another person thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process. In learning to write, the pupil goes over with his pen what the teacher has outlined in pencil: so in reading; the greater part of the work of thought is already done for us. This is why it relieves us to take up a book after being occupied with our own thoughts. And in reading, the mind is, in fact, only the playground of another’s thoughts. So it comes about that if anyone spends almost the whole day in reading, and by way of relaxation devotes the intervals to some thoughtless pastime, he gradually loses the capacity for thinking; just as the man who always rides, at last forgets how to walk. This is the case with many learned persons: they have read themselves stupid.How inappropriate to call this planet \"Earth,\" when it is clearly \"Ocean.How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded, “This is better than we thought! The Universe is much bigger than our prophets said, grander, more subtle, more elegant?The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and all science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead: his eyes are closed.Our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions any more than our opinions in physics or geometry...Rest is not idleness, and to lie sometimes on the grass under trees on a summer\\'s day, listening to the murmur of the water, or watching the clouds float across the sky, is by no means a waste of time.It is absurd for the Evolutionist to complain that it is unthinkable for an admittedly unthinkable God to make everything out of nothing, and then pretend that it is more thinkable that nothing should turn itself into everything.Faith is universal. Our specific methods for understanding it are arbitrary. Some of us pray to Jesus, some of us go to Mecca, some of us study subatomic particles. In the end we are all just searching for truth, that which is greater than ourselves.The time will come when diligent research over long periods will bring to light things which now lie hidden. A single lifetime, even though entirely devoted to the sky, would not be enough for the investigation of so vast a subject... And so this knowledge will be unfolded only through long successive ages. There will come a time when our descendants will be amazed that we did not know things that are so plain to them... Many discoveries are reserved for ages still to come, when memory of us will have been effaced.Tell me, tutor,\\' I said. \\'Is revenge a science, or an art?Religion is a culture of faith; science is a culture of doubt.I really don\\'t know why it is that all of us are so committed to the sea, except I think it\\'s because in addition to the fact that the sea changes, and the light changes, and ships change, it\\'s because we all came from the sea. And it is an interesting biological fact that all of us have in our veins the exact same percentage of salt in our blood that exists in the ocean, and, therefore, we have salt in our blood, in our sweat, in our tears. We are tied to the ocean. And when we go back to the sea - whether it is to sail or to watch it - we are going back from whence we came.[Remarks at the Dinner for the America\\'s Cup Crews, September 14 1962]First we thought the PC was a calculator. Then we found out how to turn numbers into letters with ASCII — and we thought it was a typewriter. Then we discovered graphics, and we thought it was a television. With the World Wide Web, we\\'ve realized it\\'s a brochure.Art is unquestionably one of the purest and highest elements in human happiness. It trains the mind through the eye, and the eye through the mind. As the sun colors flowers, so does art color life.Your question is the most difficult in the world. It is not a question I can answer simply with yes or no. I am not an Atheist. I do not know if I can define myself as a Pantheist. The problem involved is too vast for our limited minds. May I not reply with a parable? The human mind, no matter how highly trained, cannot grasp the universe. We are in the position of a little child, entering a huge library whose walls are covered to the ceiling with books in many different tongues. The child knows that someone must have written those books. It does not know who or how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the books, a mysterious order, which it does not comprehend, but only dimly suspects. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of the human mind, even the greatest and most cultured, toward God. We see a universe marvelously arranged, obeying certain laws, but we understand the laws only dimly. Our limited minds cannot grasp the mysterious force that sways the constellations. I am fascinated by Spinoza\\'s Pantheism. I admire even more his contributions to modern thought. Spinoza is the greatest of modern philosophers, because he is the first philosopher who deals with the soul and the body as one, not as two separate things.The science of government it is my duty to study, more than all other sciences; the arts of legislation and administration and negotiation ought to take the place of, indeed exclude, in a manner, all other arts. I must study politics and war, that our sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. Our sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history and naval architecture, navigation, commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry and porcelain.Scientists do not join hands every Sunday and sing \"Yes gravity is real! I know gravity is real! I will have faith! I believe in my heart that what goes up, up, up must come down, down, down. Amen!\" If they did, we would think they were pretty insecure about the concept.Imagine the people who believe such things and who are not ashamed to ignore, totally, all the patient findings of thinking minds through all the centuries since the Bible was written. And it is these ignorant people, the most uneducated, the most unimaginative, the most unthinking among us, who would make themselves the guides and leaders of us all; who would force their feeble and childish beliefs on us; who would invade our schools and libraries and homes. I personally resent it bitterly.The more I learn about the universe, the less convinced I am that there\\'s any sort of benevolent force that has anything to do with it, at all.I would rather have questions that can\\'t be answered than answers that can\\'t be questioned.Common sense and a sense of humor are the same thing, moving at different speeds. A sense of humor is just common sense, dancing.I believe the simplest explanation is, there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realization that there probably is no heaven and no afterlife either. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe and for that, I am extremely grateful.There are three stages in scientific discovery. First, people deny that it is true, then they deny that it is important; finally they credit the wrong person.It is impossible to escape the impression that people commonly use false standards of measurement — that they seek power, success and wealth for themselves and admire them in others, and that they underestimate what is of true value in life.Magic\\'s just science that we don\\'t understand yet.The total amount of suffering per year in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation. During the minute that it takes me to compose this sentence, thousands of animals are being eaten alive, many others are running for their lives, whimpering with fear, others are slowly being devoured from within by rasping parasites, thousands of all kinds are dying of starvation, thirst, and disease. It must be so. If there ever is a time of plenty, this very fact will automatically lead to an increase in the population until the natural state of starvation and misery is restored. In a universe of electrons and selfish genes, blind physical forces and genetic replication, some people are going to get hurt, other people are going to get lucky, and you won\\'t find any rhyme or reason in it, nor any justice. The universe that we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but pitiless indifference.One thing I have learned in a long life: that all our science, measured against reality, is primitive and childlike -- and yet it is the most precious thing we have.4. Religion. Your reason is now mature enough to examine this object. In the first place, divest yourself of all bias in favor of novelty & singularity of opinion... shake off all the fears & servile prejudices, under which weak minds are servilely crouched. Fix reason firmly in her seat, and call to her tribunal every fact, every opinion. Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason, than that of blindfolded fear. You will naturally examine first, the religion of your own country. Read the Bible, then as you would read Livy or Tacitus. The facts which are within the ordinary course of nature, you will believe on the authority of the writer, as you do those of the same kind in Livy and Tacitus. The testimony of the writer weighs in their favor, in one scale, and their not being against the laws of nature, does not weigh against them. But those facts in the Bible which contradict the laws of nature, must be examined with more care, and under a variety of faces. Here you must recur to the pretensions of the writer to inspiration from God. Examine upon what evidence his pretensions are founded, and whether that evidence is so strong, as that its falsehood would be more improbable than a change in the laws of nature, in the case he relates. For example in the book of Joshua we are told the sun stood still several hours. Were we to read that fact in Livy or Tacitus we should class it with their showers of blood, speaking of statues, beasts, &c. But it is said that the writer of that book was inspired. Examine therefore candidly what evidence there is of his having been inspired. The pretension is entitled to your inquiry, because millions believe it. On the other hand you are astronomer enough to know how contrary it is to the law of nature that a body revolving on its axis as the earth does, should have stopped, should not by that sudden stoppage have prostrated animals, trees, buildings, and should after a certain time have resumed its revolution, & that without a second general prostration. Is this arrest of the earth\\'s motion, or the evidence which affirms it, most within the law of probabilities? You will next read the New Testament. It is the history of a personage called Jesus. Keep in your eye the opposite pretensions: 1, of those who say he was begotten by God, born of a virgin, suspended & reversed the laws of nature at will, & ascended bodily into heaven; and 2, of those who say he was a man of illegitimate birth, of a benevolent heart, enthusiastic mind, who set out without pretensions to divinity, ended in believing them, and was punished capitally for sedition, by being gibbeted, according to the Roman law, which punished the first commission of that offence by whipping, & the second by exile, or death in fureâ....Do not be frightened from this inquiry by any fear of its consequences. If it ends in a belief that there is no God, you will find incitements to virtue in the comfort and pleasantness you feel in its exercise, and the love of others which it will procure you... In fine, I repeat, you must lay aside all prejudice on both sides, and neither believe nor reject anything, because any other persons, or description of persons, have rejected or believed it... I forgot to observe, when speaking of the New Testament, that you should read all the histories of Christ, as well of those whom a council of ecclesiastics have decided for us, to be Pseudo-evangelists, as those they named Evangelists. Because these Pseudo-evangelists pretended to inspiration, as much as the others, and you are to judge their pretensions by your own reason, and not by the reason of those ecclesiastics. Most of these are lost...[Letter to his nephew, Peter Carr, advising him in matters of religion, 1787]A number of years ago, when I was a freshly-appointed instructor, I met, for the first time, a certain eminent historian of science. At the time I could only regard him with tolerant condescension.I was sorry of the man who, it seemed to me, was forced to hover about the edges of science. He was compelled to shiver endlessly in the outskirts, getting only feeble warmth from the distant sun of science- in-progress; while I, just beginning my research, was bathed in the heady liquid heat up at the very center of the glow.In a lifetime of being wrong at many a point, I was never more wrong. It was I, not he, who was wandering in the periphery. It was he, not I, who lived in the blaze.I had fallen victim to the fallacy of the \\'growing edge;\\' the belief that only the very frontier of scientific advance counted; that everything that had been left behind by that advance was faded and dead.But is that true? Because a tree in spring buds and comes greenly into leaf, are those leaves therefore the tree? If the newborn twigs and their leaves were all that existed, they would form a vague halo of green suspended in mid-air, but surely that is not the tree. The leaves, by themselves, are no more than trivial fluttering decoration. It is the trunk and limbs that give the tree its grandeur and the leaves themselves their meaning.There is not a discovery in science, however revolutionary, however sparkling with insight, that does not arise out of what went before. \\'If I have seen further than other men,\\' said Isaac Newton, \\'it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants.Religion is an attempt to get control over the sensory world, in which we are placed, by means of the wish-world, which we have developed inside us as a result of biological and psychological necessities. But it cannot achieve its end. Its doctrines carry with them the stamp of the times in which they originated, the ignorant childhood days of the human race. Its consolations deserve no trust. Experience teaches us that the world is not a nursery. The ethical commands, to which religion seeks to lend its weight, require some other foundations instead, for human society cannot do without them, and it is dangerous to link up obedience to them with religious belief. If one attempts to assign to religion its place in man’s evolution, it seems not so much to be a lasting acquisition, as a parallel to the neurosis which the civilized individual must pass through on his way from childhood to maturity.The beauty of a living thing is not the atoms that go into it, but the way those atoms are put together.Problem is (follow me closely here, the science is pretty complicated), if I cut a hole in the Hab, the air won\\'t stay inside anymore.[In the Universe it may be that] Primitive life is very common and intelligent life is fairly rare. Some would say it has yet to occur on Earth.Look again at that dot. That\\'s here. That\\'s home. That\\'s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every \"superstar,\" every \"supreme leader,\" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.Nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless. There is no intelligence where there is no need of change.God creates dinosaurs, God kills dinosaurs, God creates man, man kills God, man brings back dinosaurs.There’s as many atoms in a single molecule of your DNA as there are stars in the typical galaxy. We are, each of us, a little universe.Perhaps in the back of our minds we already understand, without all the science I\\'ve discussed, that something terribly wrong is happening. Our sustenance now comes from misery. We know that if someone offers to show us a film on how our meat is produced, it will be a horror film. We perhaps know more than we care to admit, keeping it down in the dark places of our memory-- disavowed. When we eat factory-farmed meat we live, literally, on tortured flesh. Increasingly, that tortured flesh is becoming our own.[The Old Astronomer to His Pupil]Reach me down my Tycho Brahe, I would know him when we meet,When I share my later science, sitting humbly at his feet;He may know the law of all things, yet be ignorant of howWe are working to completion, working on from then to now.Pray remember that I leave you all my theory complete,Lacking only certain data for your adding, as is meet,And remember men will scorn it, \\'tis original and true,And the obloquy of newness may fall bitterly on you.But, my pupil, as my pupil you have learned the worth of scorn,You have laughed with me at pity, we have joyed to be forlorn,What for us are all distractions of men\\'s fellowship and smiles;What for us the Goddess Pleasure with her meretricious smiles.You may tell that German College that their honor comes too late,But they must not waste repentance on the grizzly savant\\'s fate.Though my soul may set in darkness, it will rise in perfect light;I have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night.What, my boy, you are not weeping? You should save your eyes for sight;You will need them, mine observer, yet for many another night.I leave none but you, my pupil, unto whom my plans are known.You \\'have none but me,\\' you murmur, and I \\'leave you quite alone\\'?Well then, kiss me, -- since my mother left her blessing on my brow,There has been a something wanting in my nature until now;I can dimly comprehend it, -- that I might have been more kind,Might have cherished you more wisely, as the one I leave behind.I \\'have never failed in kindness\\'? No, we lived too high for strife,--Calmest coldness was the error which has crept into our life;But your spirit is untainted, I can dedicate you stillTo the service of our science: you will further it? you will!There are certain calculations I should like to make with you,To be sure that your deductions will be logical and true;And remember, \\'Patience, Patience,\\' is the watchword of a sage,Not to-day nor yet to-morrow can complete a perfect age.I have sown, like Tycho Brahe, that a greater man may reap;But if none should do my reaping, \\'twill disturb me in my sleepSo be careful and be faithful, though, like me, you leave no name;See, my boy, that nothing turn you to the mere pursuit of fame.I must say Good-bye, my pupil, for I cannot longer speak;Draw the curtain back for Venus, ere my vision grows too weak:It is strange the pearly planet should look red as fiery Mars,--God will mercifully guide me on my way amongst the stars.He who is not satisfied with a little is satisfied with nothing.I consider it an extremely dangerous doctrine, because the more likely we are to assume that the solution comes from the outside, the less likely we are to solve our problems ourselves.It sounds like a fairy-tale, but not only that; this story of what man by his science and practical inventions has achieved on this earth, where he first appeared as a weakly member of the animal kingdom, and on which each individual of his species must ever again appear as a helpless infant... is a direct fulfilment of all, or of most, of the dearest wishes in his fairy-tales. All these possessions he has acquired through culture. Long ago he formed an ideal conception of omnipotence and omniscience which he embodied in his gods. Whatever seemed unattainable to his desires - or forbidden to him - he attributed to these gods. One may say, therefore, that these gods were the ideals of his culture. Now he has himself approached very near to realizing this ideal, he has nearly become a god himself. But only, it is true, in the way that ideals are usually realized in the general experience of humanity. Not completely; in some respects not at all, in others only by halves. Man has become a god by means of artificial limbs, so to speak, quite magnificent when equipped with all his accessory organs; but they do not grow on him and they still give him trouble at times... Future ages will produce further great advances in this realm of culture, probably inconceivable now, and will increase man\\'s likeness to a god still more.To invent, you need a good imagination and a pile of junk.We know very little, and yet it is astonishing that we know so much, and still more astonishing that so little knowledge can give us so much power.I suppose therefore that all things I see are illusions; I believe that nothing has ever existed of everything my lying memory tells me. I think I have no senses. I believe that body, shape, extension, motion, location are functions. What is there then that can be taken as true? Perhaps only this one thing, that nothing at all is certain.No, our science is no illusion. But an illusion it would be to suppose that what science cannot give us we can get elsewhere.Note, to-day, an instructive, curious spectacle and conflict. Science, (twin, in its fields, of Democracy in its)—Science, testing absolutely all thoughts, all works, has already burst well upon the world—a sun, mounting, most illuminating, most glorious—surely never again to set. But against it, deeply entrench\\'d, holding possession, yet remains, (not only through the churches and schools, but by imaginative literature, and unregenerate poetry,) the fossil theology of the mythic-materialistic, superstitious, untaught and credulous, fable-loving, primitive ages of humanity.Beyond work and love, I would add two other ingredients that give meaning to life. First, to fulfill whatever talents we are born with. However blessed we are by fate with different abilities and strengths, we should try to develop them to the fullest, rather than allow them to atrophy and decay. We all know individuals who did not fulfill the promise they showed in childhood. Many of them became haunted by the image of what they might have become. Instead of blaming fate, I think we should accept ourselves as we are and try to fulfill whatever dreams are within our capability.Second, we should try to leave the world a better place than when we entered it. As individuals, we can make a difference, whether it is to probe the secrets of Nature, to clean up the environment and work for peace and social justice, or to nurture the inquisitive, vibrant spirit of the young by being a mentor and a guide.Science flies you to the moon. Religion flies you into buildings.A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.I went to school in drag, in art school and my day was completely different because everybody thought I was a chick. You should see me as a chick. So I went as a girl, as like an experiment and it worked really well and everyone was really nice to me but I couldn\\'t talk obviously...you know train conductors were really cool to me on my commute...HA! I looked hot as a chick!We are trying to prove ourselves wrong as quickly as possible, because only in that way can we find progress.In questions of science, the authority of a thousand is not worth the humble reasoning of a single individual.My religious convictions and scientific views cannot at present be more specifically defined than as those of a believer in creative evolution. I desire that no public monument or work of art or inscription or sermon or ritual service commemorating me shall suggest that I accepted the tenets peculiar to any established church or denomination nor take the form of a cross or any other instrument of torture or symbol of blood sacrifice.[From the will of GBS]I would request that my body in death be buried not cremated, so that the energy content contained within it gets returned to the earth, so that flora and fauna can dine upon it, just as I have dined upon flora and fauna during my lifetimeMillions saw the apple fall, Newton was the only one who asked why?The advancement of science and the diffusion of information [is] the best aliment to true liberty.We now know the basic rules governing the universe, together with the gravitational interrelationships of its gross components, as shown in the theory of relativity worked out between 1905 and 1916. We also know the basic rules governing the subatomic particles and their interrelationships, since these are very neatly described by the quantum theory worked out between 1900 and 1930. What\\'s more, we have found that the galaxies and clusters of galaxies are the basic units of the physical universe, as discovered between 1920 and 1930....The young specialist in English Lit, having quoted me, went on to lecture me severely on the fact that in every century people have thought they understood the universe at last, and in every century they were proved to be wrong. It follows that the one thing we can say about our modern \\'knowledge\\' is that it is wrong...My answer to him was, when people thought the Earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the Earth was spherical they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the Earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the Earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together.The basic trouble, you see, is that people think that \\'right\\' and \\'wrong\\' are absolute; that everything that isn\\'t perfectly and completely right is totally and equally wrong.However, I don\\'t think that\\'s so. It seems to me that right and wrong are fuzzy concepts, and I will devote this essay to an explanation of why I think so.When my friend the English literature expert tells me that in every century scientists think they have worked out the universe and are always wrong, what I want to know is how wrong are they? Are they always wrong to the same degree?Isn’t that what it means to be a scientist? To push the boundaries of the unknown? To bravely, actively explore the enormity of our universe ?Not only is the Universe stranger than we think, it is stranger than we can think.[Said during a debate when his opponent asserted that atheism and belief in evolution lead to Nazism:]Atheism by itself is, of course, not a moral position or a political one of any kind; it simply is the refusal to believe in a supernatural dimension. For you to say of Nazism that it was the implementation of the work of Charles Darwin is a filthy slander, undeserving of you and an insult to this audience. Darwin’s thought was not taught in Germany; Darwinism was so derided in Germany along with every other form of unbelief that all the great modern atheists, Darwin, Einstein and Freud were alike despised by the National Socialist regime.Now, just to take the most notorious of the 20th century totalitarianisms – the most finished example, the most perfected one, the most ruthless and refined one: that of National Socialism, the one that fortunately allowed the escape of all these great atheists, thinkers and many others, to the United States, a country of separation of church and state, that gave them welcome – if it’s an atheistic regime, then how come that in the first chapter of Mein Kampf, that Hitler says that he’s doing God’s work and executing God’s will in destroying the Jewish people? How come the fuhrer oath that every officer of the Party and the Army had to take, making Hitler into a minor god, begins, “I swear in the name of almighty God, my loyalty to the Fuhrer?You can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world, but when you\\'re finished, you\\'ll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird... So let\\'s look at the bird and see what it\\'s doing — that\\'s what counts. I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.If you thought that science was certain - well, that is just an error on your part.There are in fact two things, science and opinion; the former begets knowledge, the latter ignorance.You develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it. From out there on the moon, international politics look so petty. You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter of a million miles out and say, ‘Look at that, you son of a bitch.It is easy to overlook this thought that life just is. As humans we are inclined to feel that life must have a point. We have plans and aspirations and desires. We want to take constant advantage of all the intoxicating existence we\\'ve been endowed with. But what\\'s life to a lichen? Yet its impulse to exist, to be, is every bit as strong as ours—arguably even stronger. If I were told that I had to spend decades being a furry growth on a rock in the woods, I believe I would lose the will to go on. Lichens don\\'t. Like virtually all living things, they will suffer any hardship, endure any insult, for a moment\\'s additional existence. Life, in short, just wants to be.It is a slightly arresting notion that if you were to pick yourself apart with tweezers, one atom at a time, you would produce a mound of fine atomic dust, none of which had ever been alive but all of which had once been you.WATNEY: Look! A pair of boobs! -> (.Y.).Sit down before fact as a little child, be prepared to give up every preconceived notion, follow humbly wherever and to whatever abysses nature leads, or you shall learn nothing. I have only begun to learn content and peace of mind since I have resolved at all risks to do this.The role played by time at the beginning of the universe is, I believe, the final key to removing the need for a Grand Designer, and revealing how the universe created itself. … Time itself must come to a stop. You can’t get to a time before the big bang, because there was no time before the big bang. We have finally found something that does not have a cause because there was no time for a cause to exist in. For me this means there is no possibility of a creator because there is no time for a creator to have existed. Since time itself began at the moment of the Big Bang, it was an event that could not have been caused or created by anyone or anything. … So when people ask me if a god created the universe, I tell them the question itself makes no sense. Time didn’t exist before the Big Bang, so there is no time for God to make the universe in. It’s like asking for directions to the edge of the Earth. The Earth is a sphere. It does not have an edge, so looking for it is a futile exercise.Scientists talk about dark matter, the invisible, mysterious substance that occupies the space between stars. Dark matter makes up 99.99 percent of the universe, and they don\\'t know what it is. Well I do. It\\'s apathy. That\\'s the truth of it; pile together everything we know and care about in the universe and it will still be nothing more than a tiny speck in the middle of a vast black ocean of Who Gives a Fuck.The knowledge that the atoms that comprise life on earth - the atoms that make up the human body, are traceable to the crucibles that cooked light elements into heavy elements in their core under extreme temperatures and pressures. These stars- the high mass ones among them- went unstable in their later years- they collapsed and then exploded- scattering their enriched guts across the galaxy- guts made of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and all the fundamental ingredients of life itself. These ingredients become part of gas clouds that condense, collapse, form the next generation of solar systems- stars with orbiting planets. And those planets now have the ingredients for life itself. So that when I look up at the night sky, and I know that yes we are part of this universe, we are in this universe, but perhaps more important than both of those facts is that the universe is in us. When I reflect on that fact, I look up- many people feel small, cause their small and the universe is big. But I feel big because my atoms came from those stars.If the bee disappeared off the face of the earth, man would only have four years left to live.Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge.Every instinct that is found in any man is in all men. The strength of the emotion may not be so overpowering, the barriers against possession not so insurmountable, the urge to accomplish the desire less keen. With some, inhibitions and urges may be neutralized by other tendencies. But with every being the primal emotions are there. All men have an emotion to kill; when they strongly dislike some one they involuntarily wish he was dead. I have never killed any one, but I have read some obituary notices with great satisfaction.Questions you cannot answer are usually far better for you than answers you cannot question.Gravity explains the motions of the planets, but it cannot explain who sets the planets in motion.You cannot reason people out of a position that they did not reason themselves into.In 2002, having spent more than three years in one residence for the first time in my life, I got called for jury duty. I show up on time, ready to serve. When we get to the voir dire, the lawyer says to me, “I see you’re an astrophysicist. What’s that?If you imagine the 4,500-bilion-odd years of Earth\\'s history compressed into a normal earthly day, then life begins very early, about 4 A.M., with the rise of the first simple, single-celled organisms, but then advances no further for the next sixteen hours. Not until almost 8:30 in the evening, with the day five-sixths over, has Earth anything to show the universe but a restless skin of microbes. Then, finally, the first sea plants appear, followed twenty minutes later by the first jellyfish and the enigmatic Ediacaran fauna first seen by Reginald Sprigg in Australia. At 9:04 P.M. trilobites swim onto the scene, followed more or less immediately by the shapely creatures of the Burgess Shale. Just before 10 P.M. plants begin to pop up on the land. Soon after, with less than two hours left in the day, the first land creatures follow. Thanks to ten minutes or so of balmy weather, by 10:24 the Earth is covered in the great carboniferous forests whose residues give us all our coal, and the first winged insects are evident. Dinosaurs plod onto the scene just before 11 P.M. and hold sway for about three-quarters of an hour. At twenty-one minutes to midnight they vanish and the age of mammals begins. Humans emerge one minute and seventeen seconds before midnight. The whole of our recorded history, on this scale, would be no more than a few seconds, a single human lifetime barely an instant. Throughout this greatly speeded-up day continents slide about and bang together at a clip that seems positively reckless. Mountains rise and melt away, ocean basins come and go, ice sheets advance and withdraw. And throughout the whole, about three times every minute, somewhere on the planet there is a flash-bulb pop of light marking the impact of a Manson-sized meteor or one even larger. It\\'s a wonder that anything at all can survive in such a pummeled and unsettled environment. In fact, not many things do for long.If time travel is possible, where are the tourists from the future?Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the more often and steadily we reflect upon them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me. I do not seek or conjecture either of them as if they were veiled obscurities or extravagances beyond the horizon of my vision; I see them before me and connect them immediately with the consciousness of my existence.A straight line is not the shortest distance between two points.When my information changes, I alter my conclusions. What do you do, sir?If you can approach the world\\'s complexities, both its glories and its horrors, with an attitude of humble curiosity, acknowledging that however deeply you have seen, you have only scratched the surface, you will find worlds within worlds, beauties you could not heretofore imagine, and your own mundane preoccupations will shrink to proper size, not all that important in the greater scheme of things.Let us try to teach generosity and altruism, because we are born selfish. Let us understand what our own selfish genes are up to, because we may then at least have the chance to upset their designs, something that no other species has ever aspired to do.I want to put on the table, not why 85% of the members of the National Academy of Sciences reject God, I want to know why 15% of the National Academy don’t.The bounties of space, of infinite outwardness, were three: empty heroics, low comedy, and pointless death.It is harder to crack prejudice than an atom.We lay there and looked up at the night sky and she told me about stars called blue squares and red swirls and I told her I\\'d never heard of them. Of course not, she said, the really important stuff they never tell you. You have to imagine it on your own.People cited violation of the First Amendment when a New Jersey schoolteacher asserted that evolution and the Big Bang are not scientific and that Noah\\'s ark carried dinosaurs. This case is not about the need to separate church and state; it\\'s about the need to separate ignorant, scientifically illiterate people from the ranks of teachers.To surrender to ignorance and call it God has always been premature, and it remains premature today.Extinction is the rule. Survival is the exception.There is a fundamental difference between religion, which is based on authority, and science, which is based on observation and reason. Science will win because it works.It is a curious situation that the sea, from which life first arose should now be threatened by the activities of one form of that life. But the sea, though changed in a sinister way, will continue to exist; the threat is rather to life itself.What I am going to tell you about is what we teach our physics students in the third or fourth year of graduate school... It is my task to convince you not to turn away because you don\\'t understand it. You see my physics students don\\'t understand it... That is because I don\\'t understand it. Nobody does.I have made a ceaseless effort not to ridicule, not to bewail, not to scorn human actions, but to understand them.We are stardust brought to life, then empowered by the universe to figure itself out—and we have only just begun.Jasnah had once defined a fool as a person who ignored information because it disagreed with desired results.Philosophy [nature] is written in that great book which ever is before our eyes -- I mean the universe -- but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which it is written. The book is written in mathematical language, and the symbols are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without whose help it is impossible to comprehend a single word of it; without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth.Science is the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and superstition.God is an ever-receding pocket of\\ufeff scientific ignorance.How can a three-pound mass of jelly that you can hold in your palm imagine angels, contemplate the meaning of infinity, and even question its own place in the cosmos? Especially awe inspiring is the fact that any single brain, including yours, is made up of atoms that were forged in the hearts of countless, far-flung stars billions of years ago. These particles drifted for eons and light-years until gravity and change brought them together here, now. These atoms now form a conglomerate- your brain- that can not only ponder the very stars that gave it birth but can also think about its own ability to think and wonder about its own ability to wonder. With the arrival of humans, it has been said, the universe has suddenly become conscious of itself. This, truly, it the greatest mystery of all.It\\'s a lazy Saturday afternoon, there\\'s a couple lying naked in bed reading Encyclopediea Brittannica to each other, and arguing about whether the Andromeda Galaxy is more \\'numinous\\' than the Ressurection. Do they know how to have a good time, or don\\'t they?One of the biggest problems with the world today is that we have large groups of people who will accept whatever they hear on the grapevine, just because it suits their worldview—not because it is actually true or because they have evidence to support it. The really striking thing is that it would not take much effort to establish validity in most of these cases… but people prefer reassurance to research.Miracles are not contrary to nature but only contrary to what we know about nature.To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at night; to be elated over a bird\\'s nest or a wildflower in spring — these are some of the rewards of the simple life.I love science, and it pains me to think that so many are terrified of the subject or feel that choosing science means you cannot also choose compassion, or the arts, or be awed by nature. Science is not meant to cure us of mystery, but to reinvent and reinvigorate it.Philosophy ... is a science, and as such has no articles of faith; accordingly, in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically, or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions.Life is and will ever remain an equation incapable of solution, but it contains certain known factors.Some people, in order to discover God, read books. But there is a great book: the very appearance of created things. Look above you! Look below you! Read it. God, whom you want to discover, never wrote that book with ink. Instead, He set before your eyes the things that He had made. Can you ask for a louder voice than that?In France, a chemist named Pilatre de Rozier tested the flammability of hydrogen by gulping a mouthful and blowing across an open flame, proving at a stroke that hydrogen is indeed explosively combustible and that eyebrows are not necessarily a permanent feature of one\\'s face.To protest about bullfighting in Spain, the eating of dogs in South Korea, or the slaughter of baby seals in Canada while continuing to eat eggs from hens who have spent their lives crammed into cages, or veal from calves who have been deprived of their mothers, their proper diet, and the freedom to lie down with their legs extended, is like denouncing apartheid in South Africa while asking your neighbors not to sell their houses to blacks.I know that the molecules in my body are traceable to phenomena in the cosmos. That makes me want to grab people on the street and say: ‘Have you HEARD THIS?I wish someone had just told me the truth right up front, as soon as I was old enough to understand it. I wish someone had just said: “Here’s the deal, Wade. You’re something called a ‘human being.’ That’s a really smart kind of animal. Like every other animal on this planet, we’re descended from a single-celled organism that lived millions of years ago. This happened by a process called evolution, and you’ll learn more about it But trust me, that’s really how we all got here. There’s proof of it everywhere, buried in the rocks. That story you heard? About how we were all created by a super-powerful dude named God who lives up in the sky? Total bullshit. The whole God thing is actually an ancient fairy tale that people have been telling one another for thousands of years. We made it all up. Like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny. “Oh, and by the way … there’s no Santa Claus or Easter Bunny. Also bullshit. Sorry, kid Deal with it.And when you look at the sky you know you are looking at stars which are hundreds and thousands of light-years away from you. And some of the stars don’t even exist anymore because their light has taken so long to get to us that they are already dead, or they have exploded and collapsed into red dwarfs. And that makes you seem very small, and if you have difficult things in you life it is nice to think that they are what is called negligible, which means they are so small you don’t have to take them into account when you are calculating something.The human spirit must prevail over technology.The downside of my celebrity is that I cannot go anywhere in the world without being recognized. It is not enough for me to wear dark sunglasses and a wig. The wheelchair gives me away.Life is funny that way. Sometimes the dumbest thing you do turns out to be the smartest.A foolish faith in authority is the worst enemy of truth.Another glorious Sierra day in which one seems to be dissolved and absorbed and sent pulsing onward we know not where. Life seems neither long nor short, and we take no more heed to save time or make haste than do the trees and stars. This is true freedom, a good practical sort of immortality.Everything that comes together falls apart. Everything. The chair I’m sitting on. It was built, and so it will fall apart. I’m gonna fall apart, probably before this chair. And you’re gonna fall apart. The cells and organs and systems that make you you—they came together, grew together, and so must fall apart. The Buddha knew one thing science didn’t prove for millennia after his death: Entropy increases. Things fall apart.We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.It\\'s been suggested that if the super-naturalists really had the powers they claim, they\\'d win the lottery every week. I prefer to point out that they could also win a Nobel Prize for discovering fundamental physical forces hitherto unknown to science. Either way, why are they wasting their talents doing party turns on television?By all means let\\'s be open-minded, but not so open-minded that our brains drop out.Human science fragments everything in order to understand it, kills everything in order to examine it. Jokes of the proper kind, properly told, can do more to enlighten questions of politics, philosophy, and literature than any number of dull arguments.John Muir, Earth — planet, Universe[Muir\\'s home address, as inscribed on the inside front cover of his first field journal]Wonder is the seed of knowledgeI am convinced that the act of thinking logically cannot possibly be natural to the human mind. If it were, then mathematics would be everybody\\'s easiest course at school and our species would not have taken several millennia to figure out the scientific method.Science may be described as the art of systematic oversimplification.Whenever a theory appears to you as the only possible one, take this as a sign that you have neither understood the theory nor the problem which it was intended to solve.Invention is the most important product of man\\'s creative brain. The ultimate purpose is the complete mastery of mind over the material world, the harnessing of human nature to human needs.In our reasonings concerning matter of fact, there are all imaginable degrees of assurance, from the highest certainty to the lowest species of moral evidence. A wise man, therefore, proportions his belief to the evidence.It\\'s natural to think that living things must be the handiwork of a designer. But it was also natural to think that the sun went around the earth. Overcoming naive impressions to figure out how things really work is one of humanity\\'s highest callings.[Can You Believe in God and Evolution? Time Magazine, August 7, 2005]I shall not commit the fashionable stupidity of regarding everything I cannot explain as a fraud.—address to the Society for Psychical Research in EnglandNo amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.It turned out I was pretty good in science. But again, because of the small budget, in science class we couldn\\'t afford to do experiments in order to prove theories. We just believed everything. Actually, I think that class was called Religion. Religion class was always an easy class. All you had to do was suspend the logic and reasoning you were being taught in all the other classes.Science is a bit like the joke about the drunk who is looking under a lamppost for a key that he has lost on the other side of the street, because that\\'s where the light is. It has no other choice.If you\\'ve got the truth you can demonstrate it. Talking doesn\\'t prove it....What I have denied and what my reason compels me to deny, is the existence of a Being throned above us as a god, directing our mundane affairs in detail, regarding us as individuals, punishing us, rewarding us as human judges might.When the churches learn to take this rational view of things, when they become true schools of ethics and stop teaching fables, they will be more effective than they are to-day... If they would turn all that ability to teaching this one thing – the fact that honesty is best, that selfishness and lies of any sort must surely fail to produce happiness – they would accomplish actual things. Religious faiths and creeds have greatly hampered our development. They have absorbed and wasted some fine intellects. That creeds are getting to be less and less important to the average mind with every passing year is a good sign, I think, although I do not wish to talk about what is commonly called theology.The criticisms which have been hurled at me have not worried me. A man cannot control his beliefs. If he is honest in his frank expression of them, that is all that can in justice be required of him. Professor Thomson and a thousand others do not in the least agree with me. His criticism of me, as I read it, charged that because I doubted the soul’s immortality, or ‘personality,’ as he called it, my mind must be abnormal, ‘pathological,’ in other, words, diseased... I try to say exactly what I honestly believe to be the truth, and more than that no man can do. I honestly believe that creedists have built up a mighty structure of inaccuracy, based, curiously, on those fundamental truths which I, with every honest man, must not alone admit but earnestly acclaim.I have been working on the same lines for many years. I have tried to go as far as possible toward the bottom of each subject I have studied. I have not reached my conclusions through study of traditions; I have reached them through the study of hard fact. I cannot see that unproved theories or sentiment should be permitted to have influence in the building of conviction upon matters so important. Science proves its theories or it rejects them. I have never seen the slightest scientific proof of the religious theories of heaven and hell, of future life for individuals, or of a personal God. I earnestly believe that I am right; I cannot help believing as I do... I cannot accept as final any theory which is not provable. The theories of the theologians cannot be proved. Proof, proof! That is what I always have been after; that is what my mind requires before it can accept a theory as fact. Some things are provable, some things disprovable, some things are doubtful. All the problems which perplex us, now, will, soon or late, be solved, and solved beyond a question through scientific investigation. The thing which most impresses me about theology is that it does not seem to be investigating. It seems to be asserting, merely, without actual study....Moral teaching is the thing we need most in this world, and many of these men could be great moral teachers if they would but give their whole time to it, and to scientific search for the rock-bottom truth, instead of wasting it upon expounding theories of theology which are not in the first place firmly based. What we need is search for fundamentals, not reiteration of traditions born in days when men knew even less than we do now.[Columbian Magazine interview]Sì perché l\\'autorità dell\\'opinione di mille nelle scienze non val per una scintilla di ragione di un solo, sì perché le presenti osservazioni spogliano d\\'autorità i decreti de\\' passati scrittori, i quali se vedute l\\'avessero, avrebbono diversamente determinato.For in the sciences the authority of thousands of opinions is not worth as much as one tiny spark of reason in an individual man. Besides, the modern observations deprive all former writers of any authority, since if they had seen what we see, they would have judged as we judge.And sometimes I believe your relentless analysis of June leaves something out, which is your feeling for her beyond knowledge, or in spite of knowledge. I often see how you sob over what you destroy, how you want to stop and just worship; and you do stop, and then a moment later you are at it again with a knife, like a surgeon.What will you do after you have revealed all there is to know about June? Truth. What ferocity in your quest of it. You destroy and you suffer. In some strange way I am not with you, I am against you. We are destined to hold two truths. I love you and I fight you. And you, the same. We will be stronger for it, each of us, stronger with our love and our hate. When you caricature and nail down and tear apart, I hate you. I want to answer you, not with weak or stupid poetry but with a wonder as strong as your reality. I want to fight your surgical knife with all the occult and magical forces of the world.You see, wire telegraph is a kind of a very, very long cat. You pull his tail in New York and his head is meowing in Los Angeles. Do you understand this? And radio operates exactly the same way: you send signals here, they receive them there. The only difference is that there is no cat.Science, you don\\'t know, looks like magic.Once there was a boy,It’s pretty confusing.Right? I don’t know why I did it. Temporary insanity, maybe. Did you ever do something that makes absolutely no sense, but you couldn’t help yourself?Wish me good luck, please,No need to be afraid. I’m just a Holon.The aim of science is not to open the door to infinite wisdom, but to set a limit to infinite error.In what terms should we think of these beings, nonhuman yet possessing so very many human-like characteristics? How should we treat them? Surely we should treat them with the same consideration and kindness as we show to other humans; and as we recognize human rights, so too should we recognize the rights of the great apes? Yes.The size and age of the Cosmos are beyond ordinary human understanding. Lost somewhere between immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home. In a cosmic perspective, most human concerns seem insignificant, even petty. And yet our species is young and curious and brave and shows much promise. In the last few millennia we have made the most astonishing and unexpected discoveries about the Cosmos and our place within it, explorations that are exhilarating to consider. They remind us that humans have evolved to wonder, that understanding is a joy, that knowledge is prerequisite to survival. I believe our future depends on how well we know this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky.Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand, and yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot? But there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men´s eyes, because they know -or think they know- some things which other men have told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to explain.In the vastness of space and the immensity of time, it is my joy to share a planet and an epoch with Annie.[Dedication to Sagan\\'s wife, Ann Druyan, in Cosmos]Highly organized research is guaranteed to produce nothing new.If this book has a lesson, it is that we are awfully lucky to be here-and by \\'we\\' I mean every living thing. To attain any kind of life in this universe of ours appears to be quite an achievement. As humans we are doubly lucky, of course: We enjoy not only the privilege of existence but also the singular ability to appreciate it and even, in a multitude of ways, to make it better. It is a talent we have only barely begun to grasp.Science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature. And that is because, in the last analysis, we ourselves are a part of the mystery that we are trying to solve.Ignorance is hardly unusual, Miss Davar. The longer I live, the more I come to realize that it is the natural state of the human mind. There are many who will strive to defend its sanctity and then expect you to be impressed with their efforts.I penetrated the outer cell membrane with a nanosyringe.\"\"You poked it with a stick?\"\"No!\" I said. \"Well. Yes. But it was a scientific poke with a very scientific stick.I agree with people like Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm – not all – that religion used to fill.rain slowly slides down the glass as if the night is crying.Even if the open windows of science at first make us shiver after the cozy indoor warmth of traditional humanizing myths, in the end the fresh air brings vigor, and the great spaces have a splendor of their own.The essence of Christianity is told us in the Garden of Eden history. The fruit that was forbidden was on the tree of knowledge. The subtext is, \\'All the suffering you have is because you wanted to find out what was going on. You could be in the Garden of Eden if you had just kept your fucking mouth shut and hadn\\'t asked any questions.Never apologize for burning too brightly or collapsing into yourself every night. That is how galaxies are made.A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.Flowers always make people better, happier, and more helpful; they are sunshine, food and medicine to the mind.Reality provides us with facts so romantic that imagination itself could add nothing to them.As to diseases, make a habit of two things — to help, or at least, to do no harm.It is often stated that of all the theories proposed in this century, the silliest is quantum theory. In fact, some say that the only thing that quantum theory has going for it is that it is unquestionably correct.In terms of doing things I take a fairly scientific approach to why things happen and how they happen. I don\\'t know if there\\'s a god or not...This most beautiful system of the sun, planets and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being...This Being governs all things, not as the soul of the world, but as Lord over all; and on account of his dominion he is wont, to be called Lord God παντοκρατωρ or Universal Ruler.Halt you villains! Unhand that science!Discovery is always rape of the natural world. Always.It turns out that an eerie type of chaos can lurk just behind a facade of order - and yet, deep inside the chaos lurks an even eerier type of order.People today have forgotten they\\'re really just a part of nature. Yet, they destroy the nature on which our lives depend. They always think they can make something better. Especially scientists. They may be smart, but most don\\'t understand the heart of nature. They only invent things that, in the end, make people unhappy. Yet they\\'re so proud of their inventions. What\\'s worse, most people are, too. They view them as if they were miracles. They worship them. They don\\'t know it, but they\\'re losing nature. They don\\'t see that they\\'re going to perish. The most important things for human beings are clean air and clean water.But what about the End of the Universe? We\\'ll miss the big moment.\"I\\'ve seen it. It\\'s rubbish,\" said Zaphod,\"nothing but a gnab gib.\"A what?\"Opposite of a big bang. Come on, let\\'s get zappy.Above all, do not attempt to use science (I mean, the real sciences) as a defence against Christianity. They will positively encourage him to think about realities he can’t touch and see. May it [American independence] be to the world, what I believe it will be, (to some parts sooner, to others later, but finally to all,) the signal of arousing men to burst the chains under which monkish ignorance and superstition had persuaded them to bind themselves, and to assume the blessings and security of self-government. That form which we have substituted, restores the free right to the unbounded exercise of reason and freedom of opinion. All eyes are opened, or opening, to the rights of man. The general spread of the light of science has already laid open to every view the palpable truth, that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately... These are grounds of hope for others. For ourselves, let the annual return of this day forever refresh our recollections of these rights, and an undiminished devotion to them.[Letter to Roger C. Weightman on the anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, 24 June 1826. This was Jefferson\\'s last letter]What is it with science these days? Everyone is so quick to believe in it, in all these new scientific discoveries, new pills for this, new pills for that. Get thinner, grow hair, yada, yada, yada, but when it requires a little faith in something you all go crazy.\\' He shook his head, \\'If miracles had chemical equations then everyone would believe.You can observe a lot just by watching.Now, the invention of the scientific method and science is, I\\'m sure we\\'ll all agree, the most powerful intellectual idea, the most powerful framework for thinking and investigating and understanding and challenging the world around us that there is, and that it rests on the premise that any idea is there to be attacked and if it withstands the attack then it lives to fight another day and if it doesn\\'t withstand the attack then down it goes. Religion doesn\\'t seem to work like that; it has certain ideas at the heart of it which we call sacred or holy or whatever. That\\'s an idea we\\'re so familiar with, whether we subscribe to it or not, that it\\'s kind of odd to think what it actually means, because really what it means is \\'Here is an idea or a notion that you\\'re not allowed to say anything bad about; you\\'re just not. Why not? - because you\\'re not!We are at the very beginning of time for the human race. It is not unreasonable that we grapple with problems. But there are tens of thousands of years in the future. Our responsibility is to do what we can, learn what we can, improve the solutions, and pass them on.As for what it\\'s against - the story is against those who pervert and misuse religion, or any other kind of doctrine with a holy book and a priesthood and an apparatus of power that wields unchallengeable authority, in order to dominate and suppress human freedoms.The chief deficiency I see in the skeptical movement is its polarization: Us vs. Them — the sense that we have a monopoly on the truth; that those other people who believe in all these stupid doctrines are morons; that if you\\'re sensible, you\\'ll listen to us; and if not, to hell with you. This is nonconstructive. It does not get our message across. It condemns us to permanent minority status.Many of us saw religion as harmless nonsense. Beliefs might lack all supporting evidence but, we thought, if people needed a crutch for consolation, where\\'s the harm? September 11th changed all that.We rich nations, for that is what we are, have an obligation not only to the poor nations, but to all the grandchildren of the world, rich and poor. We have not inherited this earth from our parents to do with it what we will. We have borrowed it from our children and we must be careful to use it in their interests as well as our own. Anyone who fails to recognise the basic validity of the proposition put in different ways by increasing numbers of writers, from Malthus to The Club of Rome, is either ignorant, a fool, or evil.We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita; Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty, and to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, \\'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.\\' I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.When it came time for me to give my talk on the subject, I started off by drawing an outline of the cat and began to name the various muscles.The other students in the class interrupt me: \"We *know* all that!\"\"Oh,\" I say, \"you *do*? Then no *wonder* I can catch up with you so fast after you\\'ve had four years of biology.\" They had wasted all their time memorizing stuff like that, when it could be looked up in fifteen minutes.When scientifically investigating the natural world, the only thing worse than a blind believer is a seeing denier.Now, my own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose. I have read and heard many attempts at a systematic account of it, from materialism and theosophy to the Christian system or that of Kant, and I have always felt that they were much too simple. I suspect that there are more things in heaven and earth that are dreamed of, or can be dreamed of, in any philosophy. That is the reason why I have no philosophy myself, and must be my excuse for dreaming.Science is the process that takes us from confusion to understanding...Nothing exists except atoms and empty space; everything else is opinion.Those who are not shocked when they first come across quantum theory cannot possibly have understood it.Be patient with him. If the same quality did not exist in you, you wouldn’t notice it in him.The greatest blessing granted to mankind come by way of madness, which is a divine gift.A society\\'s competitive advantage will come not from how well its schools teach the multiplication and periodic tables, but from how well they stimulate imagination and creativity.Science, my boy, is made up of mistakes, but they are mistakes which it is useful to make, because they lead little by little to the truth.Science is like sex: sometimes something useful comes out, but that is not the reason we are doing it. A celibate clergy is an especially good idea, because it tends to suppress any hereditary propensity toward fanaticism.Every intelligent being, whether it breathes or not, coughs nervously at some time in its life.If our brains were simple enough for us to understand them, we\\'d be so simple that we couldn\\'t.Suppose that we are wise enough to learn and know—and yet not wise enough to control our learning and knowledge, so that we use it to destroy ourselves? Even if that is so, knowledge remains better than ignorance. It is better to know—even if the knowledge endures only for the moment that comes before destruction—than to gain eternal life at the price of a dull and swinish lack of comprehension of a universe that swirls unseen before us in all its wonder. That was the choice of Achilles, and it is mine, too.Interviewer: Didn\\'t Sagan want to believe?Druyan: he didn\\'t want to believe. he wanted to know.We owe a huge debt to Galileo for emancipating us all from the stupid belief in an Earth-centered or man-centered (let alone God-centered) system. He quite literally taught us our place and allowed us to go on to make extraordinary advances in knowledge.I regard the afterlife to be a fairy story for people that are afraid of the darkThinking only begins at the point where we have come to know that Reason, glorified for centuries, is the most obstinate adversary of thinking.Now I\\'m a scientific expert; that means I know nothing about absolutely everything.Be humble for you are made of earth. Be noble for you are made of stars.But in my opinion, all things in nature occur mathematically.One of the penalties of an ecological education is that one lives alone in a world of wounds. Much of the damage inflicted on land is quite invisible to laymen. An ecologist must either harden his shell and make believe that the consequences of science are none of his business, or he must be the doctor who sees the marks of death in a community that believes itself well and does not want to be told otherwise.Do not become someone else just because you are hurt. Be who you are & smile, it may solve, all problems you have got.The feeling of awed wonder that science can give us is one of the highest experiences of which the human psyche is capable. It is a deep aesthetic passion to rank with the finest that music and poetry can deliver. It is truly one of the things that make life worth living and it does so, if anything, more effectively if it convinces us that the time we have for living is quite finite.It\\'s so hard to believe in anything anymore. I mean, it\\'s like, religion, you really can\\'t take it seriously, because it seems so mythological, it seems so arbitrary...but, on the other hand, science is just pure empiricism, and by virtue of its method, it excludes metaphysics. I guess I wouldn\\'t believe in anything anymore if it weren\\'t for my lucky astrology mood watch.All sciences are vain and full of errors that are not born of Experience, the mother of all Knowledge.We are all star stuff.We feel that even if all possible scientific questions be answered, the problems of life have still not been touched at all.Avoidable human misery is more often caused not so much by stupidity as by ignorance, particularly our ignorance about ourselves.We are survival machines – robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes. This is a truth which still fills me with astonishment.Riza: Without his Alchemy he\\'s just...Jean: A little brat who swears a lotMaes: An arrogant pipsqueakRoy: Useless. Just uselessAlphonse: Sorry big brother, I don\\'t know how to add to that...Ed *starts to cry*: YOU\\'RE ALL PICKING ON ME!!!That\\'s the whole problem with science. You\\'ve got a bunch of empiricists trying to describe things of unimaginable wonder.Consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms. For consciousness is absolutely fundamental. It cannot be accounted for in terms of anything else.You may live to see man-made horrors beyond your comprehension.You know what\\'s wrong with scientific power? It\\'s a form of inherited wealth. And you know what assholes congenitally rich people are.It has become almost a cliché to remark that nobody boasts of ignorance of literature, but it is socially acceptable to boast ignorance of science and proudly claim incompetence in mathematics.A blade of grass is a commonplace on Earth; it would be a miracle on Mars. Our descendants on Mars will know the value of a patch of green. And if a blade of grass is priceless, what is the value of a human being?Philosophy of science is about as useful to scientists as ornithology is to birds.Ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants. We know more about war than we know about peace, more about killing than we know about living. We have grasped the mystery of the atom and rejected the Sermon on the Mount.We understand more than we know.Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer; art is everything else.I remember discussions with Bohr which went through many hours till very late at night and ended almost in despair; and when at the end of the discussion I went alone for a walk in the neighbouring park I repeated to myself again and again the question: Can nature possibly be so absurd as it seemed to us in these atomic experiments?The invisible and the non-existent look very much alike.The real purpose of the scientific method is to make sure nature hasn’t misled you into thinking you know something you actually don’t know.The Universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose.The more clearly we can focus our attention on the wonders and realities of the universe about us the less taste we shall have for the destruction of our race. Wonder and humility are wholesome emotions, and they do not exist side by side with a lust for destruction.{Speech accepting the John Burroughs Medal}Now,I\\'m no scientist,but I know what endorphins are. They\\'re tiny little magical elves that swim through your blood stream and tell funny jokes to each other. When they reach your brain,you hear what they\\'re saying and that boosts your health and happiness. \"Knock Knock... Who\\'s There?.. Little endorphin... Little endorphin who?... Little Endorphin Annie.\" And then the endorphins laugh and then you laugh. See? Its Science.No one ever said that you would live to see the repercussions of everything you do, or that you have guarantees, or that you are not obliged to wander in the dark, or that everything will be proved to you and neatly verified like something in science. Nothing is: at least nothing that is worthwhile. I didn\\'t bring you up only to move across sure ground. I didn\\'t teach you to think that everything must be within our control or understanding. Did I? For, if I did, I was wrong. I fyou won\\'t take a chance, then the powers you refuse because you cannot explain them, will, as they say, make a monkey out of you.Log Entry: SOL 118My conversation with NASA about the Water Reclaimer was boring and riddled with technical details. So I\\'ll paraphrase for you:Me: \"This is obviously a clog. How about I take it apart and check the internal tubing?\"NASA: (After about 5 hours of deliberation) \"No. You\\'ll fuck it up and die.\"So I took it apart.[When asked why are numbers beautiful?]It’s like asking why is Ludwig van Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony beautiful. If you don\\'t see why, someone can\\'t tell you. I know numbers are beautiful. If they aren\\'t beautiful, nothing is.As we all know, blinking lights means science.It doesn\\'t seem to me that this fantastically marvelous universe, this tremendous range of time and space and different kinds of animals, and all the different planets, and all these atoms with all their motions, and so on, all this complicated thing can merely be a stage so that God can watch human beings struggle for good and evil - which is the view that religion has. The stage is too big for the drama.You could give Aristotle a tutorial. And you could thrill him to the core of his being. Aristotle was an encyclopedic polymath, an all time intellect. Yet not only can you know more than him about the world. You also can have a deeper understanding of how everything works. Such is the privilege of living after Newton, Darwin, Einstein, Planck, Watson, Crick and their colleagues.I\\'m not saying you\\'re more intelligent than Aristotle, or wiser. For all I know, Aristotle\\'s the cleverest person who ever lived. That\\'s not the point. The point is only that science is cumulative, and we live later.Equipped with his five senses, man explores the universe around him and calls the adventure Science.From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of particular interest. But for us, it\\'s different. Consider again that dot. That\\'s here, that\\'s home, that\\'s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every \"superstar,\" every \"supreme leader,\" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there – on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand. It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we\\'ve ever known.Science is always discovering odd scraps of magical wisdom and making a tremendous fuss about its cleverness.We are star stuff harvesting sunlight.In a very real sense we have two minds, one that thinks and one that feelsWe are star stuff which has taken its destiny into its own hands.When asked about which scientist he\\'d like to meet, Neil deGrasse Tyson said, \"Isaac Newton. No question about it. The smartest person ever to walk the face of this earth. The man was connected to the universe in spooky ways. He discovered the laws of motion, the laws of gravity, the laws of optics. Then he turned 26.She noted, more than once, that the meteor shower was happening, beyond the overcast sky, even if we could not see it. Who cares if she can kiss? She can see through the clouds.Our DNA is coded to harmonise the frequency of the atoms we use to build ourselves. The frequencies of the subatomic particles making up the atoms are changed subtly enough to do this but not enough to change their structure. You could say throughout our development, from birth to death, our genes are composing a harmonic symphony that makes us what we are. It\\'s what makes us individual; it\\'s our life force, our soul.Ann Druyan suggests an experiment: Look back again at the pale blue dot of the preceding chapter. Take a good long look at it. Stare at the dot for any length of time and then try to convince yourself that God created the whole Universe for one of the 10 million or so species of life that inhabit that speck of dust. Now take it a step further: Imagine that everything was made just for a single shade of that species, or gender, or ethnic or religious subdivision. If this doesn’t strike you as unlikely, pick another dot. Imagine it to be inhabited by a different form of intelligent life. They, too, cherish the notion of a God who has created everything for their benefit. How seriously do you take their claim?And a new philosophy emerged called quantum physics, which suggest that the individual’s function is to inform and be informed. You really exist only when you’re in a field sharing and exchanging information. You create the realities you inhabit.One general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.If we long for our planet to be important, there is something we can do about it. We make our world significant by the courage of our questions and by the depth of our answers....But I own that I cannot see as plainly as others do, and as I should wish to do, evidence of design and beneficence on all sides of us. There seems to me too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidæ with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of Caterpillars, or that a cat should play with mice... I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the mind of Newton. Let each man hope and believe what he can.Nature and Nature\\'s laws lay hid in night:God said, Let Newton be! and all was light.I am too much of a skeptic to deny the possibility of anything.Scientists are a friendly, atheistic, hard-working, beer-drinking lot whose minds are preoccupied with sex, chess and baseball when they are not preoccupied with science.I believe that the universe was formed around 15 billion years ago and that humans have evolved from their apelike ancestors over the past few million years. I believe we are more likely to live a good life if all humans try to work together in a world community, preserving planet earth. When decisions for groups are made in this world, I believe that the democratic process should be used. To protect the individual, I believe in freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, freedom from religion, freedom of inquiry, and a wall of separation between church and state. When making decisions about what is right or wrong, I believe I should use my intelligence to reason about the likely consequences of my actions. I believe that I should try to increase the happiness of everyone by caring for other people and finding ways to cooperate. Never should my actions discriminate against people simply because of their race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, or national origin. I believe that ideas about what is right and wrong will change with education, so I am prepared to continually question ideas using evidence from experience and science. I believe there is no valid evidence to support claims for the existence of supernatural entities and deities. I will use these beliefs to guide my thinking and my actions until I find good reasons for revising them or replacing them with other beliefs that are more valid.The man of science has learned to believe in justification, not by faith, but by verification.Needless to say, jamming deformed, drugged, overstressed birds together in a filthy, waste-coated room is not very healthy. Beyond deformities, eye damage, blindness, bacterial infections of bones, slipped vertebrae, paralysis, internal bleeding, anemia, slipped tendons, twisted lower legs and necks, respiratory diseases, and weakened immune systems are frequent and long-standing problems on factory farms.And if humanity is the last war, then I am the battlefield.The night before brain surgery, I thought about death. I searched out my larger values, and I asked myself, if I was going to die, did I want to do it fighting and clawing or in peaceful surrender? What sort of character did I hope to show? Was I content with myself and what I had done with my life so far? I decided that I was essentially a good person, although I could have been better--but at the same time I understood that the cancer didn\\'t care.I asked myself what I believed. I had never prayed a lot. I hoped hard, I wished hard, but I didn\\'t pray. I had developed a certain distrust of organized religion growing up, but I felt I had the capacity to be a spiritual person, and to hold some fervent beliefs. Quite simply, I believed I had a responsibility to be a good person, and that meant fair, honest, hardworking, and honorable. If I did that, if I was good to my family, true to my friends, if I gave back to my community or to some cause, if I wasn\\'t a liar, a cheat, or a thief, then I believed that should be enough. At the end of the day, if there was indeed some Body or presence standing there to judge me, I hoped I would be judged on whether I had lived a true life, not on whether I believed in a certain book, or whether I\\'d been baptized. If there was indeed a God at the end of my days, I hoped he didn\\'t say, \\'But you were never a Christian, so you\\'re going the other way from heaven.\\' If so, I was going to reply, \\'You know what? You\\'re right. Fine.\\'I believed, too, in the doctors and the medicine and the surgeries--I believed in that. I believed in them. A person like Dr. Einhorn [his oncologist], that\\'s someone to believe in, I thought, a person with the mind to develop an experimental treatment 20 years ago that now could save my life. I believed in the hard currency of his intelligence and his research.Beyond that, I had no idea where to draw the line between spiritual belief and science. But I knew this much: I believed in belief, for its own shining sake. To believe in the face of utter hopelessness, every article of evidence to the contrary, to ignore apparent catastrophe--what other choice was there? We do it every day, I realized. We are so much stronger than we imagine, and belief is one of the most valiant and long-lived human characteristics. To believe, when all along we humans know that nothing can cure the briefness of this life, that there is no remedy for our basic mortality, that is a form of bravery.To continue believing in yourself, believing in the doctors, believing in the treatment, believing in whatever I chose to believe in, that was the most important thing, I decided. It had to be.Without belief, we would be left with nothing but an overwhelming doom, every single day. And it will beat you. I didn\\'t fully see, until the cancer, how we fight every day against the creeping negatives of the world, how we struggle daily against the slow lapping of cynicism. Dispiritedness and disappointment, these were the real perils of life, not some sudden illness or cataclysmic millennium doomsday. I knew now why people fear cancer: because it is a slow and inevitable death, it is the very definition of cynicism and loss of spirit.So, I believed.Down there between our legs, it\\'s like an entertainment complex in the middle of a sewage system. Who designed that?It is very expensive to give bad medical care to poor people in a rich country.I think imagination is at the heart of everything we do. Scientific discoveries couldn\\'t have happened without imagination. Art, music, and literature couldn\\'t exist without imagination. And so anything that strengthens imagination, and reading certainly does that, can help us for the rest of our lives.There exists indeed an opposition to it [building of UVA, Jefferson\\'s secular college] by the friends of William and Mary, which is not strong. The most restive is that of the priests of the different religious sects, who dread the advance of science as witches do the approach of day-light; and scowl on it the fatal harbinger announcing the subversion of the duperies on which they live. In this the Presbyterian clergy take the lead. The tocsin is sounded in all their pulpits, and the first alarm denounced is against the particular creed of Doctr. Cooper; and as impudently denounced as if they really knew what it is.[Letter to José Francesco Corrê a Da Serra - Monticello, April 11, 1820]Not a single one of the cells that compose you knows who you are, or cares.Faith and science, I have learned, are two sides of the same coin, separated by an expanse so small, but wide enough that one side can\\'t see the other. They don\\'t know they are connected.The idea that God is an oversized white male with a flowing beard, who sits in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous. But if by \\'God,\\' one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe, then clearly there is such a God. This God is emotionally unsatisfying... it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity.There is nothing which can better deserve our patronage than the promotion of science and literature. Knowledge is in every country the surest basis of public happiness.The scientist does not study nature because it is useful to do so. He studies it because he takes pleasure in it, and he takes pleasure in it because it is beautiful. If nature were not beautiful it would not be worth knowing, and life would not be worth living. I am not speaking, of course, of the beauty which strikes the senses, of the beauty of qualities and appearances. I am far from despising this, but it has nothing to do with science. What I mean is that more intimate beauty which comes from the harmonious order of its parts, and which a pure intelligence can grasp.So it is best to keep an open mind and be agnostic. At first sight that seems an unassailable position, at least in the weak sense of Pascal\\'s wager. But on second thoughts it seems a cop-out, because the same could be said of Father Christmas and tooth fairies. There may be fairies at the bottom of the garden. There is no evidence for it, but you can\\'t prove that there aren\\'t any, so shouldn\\'t we be agnostic with respect to fairies?I believe in intuition and inspiration. Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution. It is, strictly speaking, a real factor in scientific research.It doesn\\'t matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn\\'t matter how smart you are. If it doesn\\'t agree with experiment, it\\'s wrong.History repeats, but science reverberates.Study, along the lines which the theologies have mapped, will never lead us to discovery of the fundamental facts of our existence. That goal must be attained by means of exact science and can only be achieved by such means. The fact that man, for ages, has superstitiously believed in what he calls a God does not prove at all that his theory has been right. There have been many gods – all makeshifts, born of inability to fathom the deep fundamental truth. There must be something at the bottom of existence, and man, in ignorance, being unable to discover what it is through reason, because his reason has been so imperfect, undeveloped, has used, instead, imagination, and created figments, of one kind or another, which, according to the country he was born in, the suggestions of his environment, satisfied him for the time being. Not one of all the gods of all the various theologies has ever really been proved. We accept no ordinary scientific fact without the final proof; why should we, then, be satisfied in this most mighty of all matters, with a mere theory?Destruction of false theories will not decrease the sum of human happiness in future, any more than it has in the past... The days of miracles have passed. I do not believe, of course, that there was ever any day of actual miracles. I cannot understand that there were ever any miracles at all. My guide must be my reason, and at thought of miracles my reason is rebellious. Personally, I do not believe that Christ laid claim to doing miracles, or asserted that he had miraculous power...Our intelligence is the aggregate intelligence of the cells which make us up. There is no soul, distinct from mind, and what we speak of as the mind is just the aggregate intelligence of cells. It is fallacious to declare that we have souls apart from animal intelligence, apart from brains. It is the brain that keeps us going. There is nothing beyond that.Life goes on endlessly, but no more in human beings than in other animals, or, for that matter, than in vegetables. Life, collectively, must be immortal, human beings, individually, cannot be, as I see it, for they are not the individuals – they are mere aggregates of cells.There is no supernatural. We are continually learning new things. There are powers within us which have not yet been developed and they will develop. We shall learn things of ourselves, which will be full of wonders, but none of them will be beyond the natural.[Columbian Magazine interview]CIRCLES OF LIFEEverythingTurns,Rotates,Spins,Circles,Loops,Pulsates,Resonates,AndRepeats.CirclesOf life,Born fromPulsesOf light,VibrateToBreathe,WhileSpiralingOutwardsForInfinityThroughThe lensOf time,And intoA seaOf starsAndLucidDreams.Poetry by Suzy KassemIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree -- make sure you understand the fundamental principles, ie the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.An honest bookstore would post the following sign above its \\'self-help\\' section: \\'For true self-help, please visit our philosophy, literature, history and science sections, find yourself a good book, read it, and think about it.Energy is liberated matter, matter is energy waiting to happen.People who believe they are ignorant of nothing have neither looked for, nor stumbled upon, the boundary between what is known and unknown in the universe.The bright sun was extinguish\\'d, and the starsDid wander darkling in the eternal space.Were these boys in their right minds? Here were two boys with good intellect, one eighteen and one nineteen. They had all the prospects that life could hold out for any of the young; one a graduate of Chicago and another of Ann Arbor; one who had passed his examination for the Harvard Law School and was about to take a trip in Europe,--another who had passed at Ann Arbor, the youngest in his class, with three thousand dollars in the bank. Boys who never knew what it was to want a dollar; boys who could reach any position that was to boys of that kind to reach; boys of distinguished and honorable families, families of wealth and position, with all the world before them. And they gave it all up for nothing, for nothing! They took a little companion of one of them, on a crowded street, and killed him, for nothing, and sacrificed everything that could be of value in human life upon the crazy scheme of a couple of immature lads.Now, your Honor, you have been a boy; I have been a boy. And we have known other boys. The best way to understand somebody else is to put yourself in his place.Is it within the realm of your imagination that a boy who was right, with all the prospects of life before him, who could choose what he wanted, without the slightest reason in the world would lure a young companion to his death, and take his place in the shadow of the gallows?...No one who has the process of reasoning could doubt that a boy who would do that is not right.How insane they are I care not, whether medically or legally. They did not reason; they could not reason; they committed the most foolish, most unprovoked, most purposeless, most causeless act that any two boys ever committed, and they put themselves where the rope is dangling above their heads....Why did they kill little Bobby Franks?Not for money, not for spite; not for hate. They killed him as they might kill a spider or a fly, for the experience. They killed him because they were made that way. Because somewhere in the infinite processes that go to the making up of the boy or the man something slipped, and those unfortunate lads sit here hated, despised, outcasts, with the community shouting for their blood.. . . I know, Your Honor, that every atom of life in all this universe is bound up together. I know that a pebble cannot be thrown into the ocean without disturbing every drop of water in the sea. I know that every life is inextricably mixed and woven with every other life. I know that every influence, conscious and unconscious, acts and reacts on every living organism, and that no one can fix the blame. I know that all life is a series of infinite chances, which sometimes result one way and sometimes another. I have not the infinite wisdom that can fathom it, neither has any other human brainThe effort to understand the universe is one of the very few things that lifts human life a little above the level of farce, and gives it some of the grace of tragedy. Mankind flung its advance agents ever outward, ever outward. Eventually it flung them out into space, into the colorless, tasteless, weightless sea of outwardness without end. It flung them like stones.We don\\'t want to conquer the cosmos, we simply want to extend the boundaries of Earth to the frontiers of the cosmos.They didn\\'t understand what they were doing.I\\'m afraid that will be on the tombstone of the human race.A real scientist solves problems, not wails that they are unsolvable.It\\'s very, very dangerous to lose contact with living nature.Science adjusts its views based on what\\'s observedFaith is the denial of observation so that belief can be preserved.The following proposition seems to me in a high degree probable—namely, that any animal whatever, endowed with well-marked social instincts, the parental and filial affections being here included, would inevitably acquire a moral sense or conscience, as soon as its intellectual powers had become as well, or nearly as well developed, as in man. For, firstly, the social instincts lead an animal to take pleasure in the society of its fellows, to feel a certain amount of sympathy with them, and to perform various services for them.We can allow satellites, planets, suns, universe, nay whole systems of universe, to be governed by laws, but the smallest insect, we wish to be created at once by special act.Nothing is easier than to admit in words the truth of the universal struggle for life, or more difficult--at least I have found it so--than constantly to bear this conclusion in mind.Discovery consists of looking at the same thing as everyone else and thinking something different.If time be judiciously employed, there is time for everything.Nature composes some of her loveliest poems for the microscope and the telescope.My dear Kepler, what would you say of the learned here, who, replete with the pertinacity of the asp, have steadfastly refused to cast a glance through the telescope? What shall we make of this? Shall we laugh, or shall we cry?Kids are never the problem. They are born scientists. The problem is always the adults. They beat the curiosity out of kids. They outnumber kids. They vote. They wield resources. That\\'s why my public focus is primarily adults.We have become, by the power of a glorious evolutionary accident called intelligence, the stewards of life\\'s continuity on earth. We did not ask for this role, but we cannot abjure it. We may not be suited to it, but here we are.Reason, Observation and Experience — the Holy Trinity of Science — have taught us that happiness is the only good; that the time to be happy is now, and the way to be happy is to make others so. This is enough for us. In this belief we are content to live and die. If by any possibility the existence of a power superior to, and independent of, nature shall be demonstrated, there will then be time enough to kneel. Until then, let us stand erect.There is no royal road to science, and only those who do not dread the fatiguing climb of its steep paths have a chance of gaining its luminous summits.Man is manifestly not the measure of all things. This universe is shot through with mystery. The very fact of its being, and of our own, is a mystery absolute, and the only miracle worthy of the name.In 5 billion years, the expansion of the universe will have progressed to the point where all other galaxies will have receded beyond detection. Indeed, they will be receding faster than the speed of light, so detection will be impossible. Future civilizations will discover science and all its laws, and never know about other galaxies or the cosmic background radiation. They will inevitably come to the wrong conclusion about the universe......We live in a special time, the only time, where we can observationally verify that we live in a special time.Never underestimate spite as a motivator for genius.Anyone who values truth should stop worshipping reason.The Cosmos extends, for all practical purposes, forever. After a brief sedentary hiatus, we are resuming our ancient nomadic way of life. Our remote descendants, safely arrayed on many worlds throughout the Solar System and beyond, will be unified by their common heritage, by their regard for their home planet, and by the knowledge that, whatever other life may be, the only humans in all the Universe come from Earth. They will gaze up and strain to find the blue dot in their skies. They will love it no less for its obscurity and fragility. They will marvel at how vulnerable the repository of all our potential once was, how perilous our infancy, how humble our beginnings, how many rivers we had to cross before we found our way.We must pass through the darkness, to reach the light.Everyone has a hidden agenda. Except me!Just because an apple falls one hundred times out of a hundred does not mean it will fall on the hundred and first.Mother Nature doesn\\'t care if you\\'re having fun. Science replaces private prejudice with public, verifiable evidence.In practical life we are compelled to follow what is most probable ; in speculative thought we are compelled to follow truth.The scientist only imposes two things, namely truth and sincerity, imposes them upon himself and upon other scientists.We are built to be effective animals, not happy ones.Are you really surprised by the endurance of religion? What ideology is likely to be more durable than one that conforms, at every turn, to our powers of wishful thinking? Hope is easy; knowledge is hard. Science is the one domain in which we human beings make a truly heroic effort to counter our innate biases and wishful thinking. Science is the one endeavor in which we have developed a refined methodology for separating what a person hopes is true from what he has good reason to believe. The methodology isn\\'t perfect, and the history of science is riddled with abject failures of scientific objectivity. But that is just the point-these have been failures of science, discovered and corrected by-what, religion? No, by good science.It was the general opinion of ancient nations, that the divinity alone was adequate to the important office of giving laws to men... and modern nations, in the consecrations of kings, and in several superstitious chimeras of divine rights in princes and nobles, are nearly unanimous in preserving remnants of it... Is the jealousy of power, and the envy of superiority, so strong in all men, that no considerations of public or private utility are sufficient to engage their submission to rules for their own happiness? Or is the disposition to imposture so prevalent in men of experience, that their private views of ambition and avarice can be accomplished only by artifice? — … There is nothing in which mankind have been more unanimous; yet nothing can be inferred from it more than this, that the multitude have always been credulous, and the few artful. The United States of America have exhibited, perhaps, the first example of governments erected on the simple principles of nature: and if men are now sufficiently enlightened to disabuse themselves of artifice, imposture, hypocrisy, and superstition, they will consider this event as an era in their history. Although the detail of the formation of the American governments is at present little known or regarded either in Europe or America, it may hereafter become an object of curiosity. It will never be pretended that any persons employed in that service had any interviews with the gods, or were in any degree under the inspiration of heaven, any more than those at work upon ships or houses, or labouring in merchandize or agriculture: it will for ever be acknowledged that these governments were contrived merely by the use of reason and the senses. As Copley painted Chatham, West, Wolf, and Trumbull, Warren and Montgomery; as Dwight, Barlow, Trumbull, and Humphries composed their verse, and Belknap and Ramzay history; as Godfrey invented his quadrant, and Rittenhouse his planetarium; as Boylston practised inoculation, and Franklin electricity; as Paine exposed the mistakes of Raynal, and Jefferson those of Buffon, so unphilosophically borrowed from the Recherches Philosophiques sur les Américains those despicable dreams of de Pauw — neither the people, nor their conventions, committees, or sub-committees, considered legislation in any other light than ordinary arts and sciences, only as of more importance. Called without expectation, and compelled without previous inclination, though undoubtedly at the best period of time both for England and America, to erect suddenly new systems of laws for their future government, they adopted the method of a wise architect, in erecting a new palace for the residence of his sovereign. They determined to consult Vitruvius, Palladio, and all other writers of reputation in the art; to examine the most celebrated buildings, whether they remain entire or in ruins; compare these with the principles of writers; and enquire how far both the theories and models were founded in nature, or created by fancy: and, when this should be done, as far as their circumstances would allow, to adopt the advantages, and reject the inconveniences, of all. Unembarrassed by attachments to noble families, hereditary lines and successions, or any considerations of royal blood, even the pious mystery of holy oil had no more influence than that other of holy water: the people universally were too enlightened to be imposed on by artifice; and their leaders, or more properly followers, were men of too much honour to attempt it. Thirteen governments thus founded on the natural authority of the people alone, without a pretence of miracle or mystery, which are destined to spread over the northern part of that whole quarter of the globe, are a great point gained in favour of the rights of mankind.[Preface to \\'A Defence of the Constitutions of the United States of America\\', 1787]THE MAXIMS OF MEDICINE Before you examine the body of a patient,Be patient to learn his story.For once you learn his story,You will also come to knowHis body.Before you diagnose any sickness,Make sure there is no sickness in the mind or heart.For the emotions in a man’s moon or sun,Can point to the sickness inAny one of his other parts.Before you treat a man with a condition,Know that not all cures can heal all people.For the chemistry that works on one patient,May not work for the next,Because even medicine has its ownConditions.Before asserting a prognosis on any patient,Always be objective and never subjective.For telling a man that he will win the treasure of life,But then later discovering that he will lose,Will harm him more than by telling himThat he may lose,But then he wins. THE MAXIMS OF MEDICINE by Suzy KassemScience is opposed to theological dogmas because science is founded on fact. To me, the universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end. The human being is no exception to the natural order. Man, like the universe, is a machine. Nothing enters our minds or determines our actions which is not directly or indirectly a response to stimuli beating upon our sense organs from without. Owing to the similarity of our construction and the sameness of our environment, we respond in like manner to similar stimuli, and from the concordance of our reactions, understanding is born. In the course of ages, mechanisms of infinite complexity are developed, but what we call \\'soul\\' or \\'spirit,\\' is nothing more than the sum of the functionings of the body. When this functioning ceases, the \\'soul\\' or the \\'spirit\\' ceases likewise.I expressed these ideas long before the behaviorists, led by Pavlov in Russia and by Watson in the United States, proclaimed their new psychology. This apparently mechanistic conception is not antagonistic to an ethical conception of life.Quantum mechanics describes nature as absurd from the point of view of common sense. And yet it fully agrees with experiment. So I hope you can accept nature as She is - absurd.In God we trust. All others [must] have data. - Bernard FisherToday the most civilized countries of the world spend a maximum of their income on war and a minimum on education. The twenty-first century will reverse this order. It will be more glorious to fight against ignorance than to die on the field of battle. The discovery of a new scientific truth will be more important than the squabbles of diplomats. Even the newspapers of our own day are beginning to treat scientific discoveries and the creation of fresh philosophical concepts as news. The newspapers of the twenty-first century will give a mere \\'stick\\' in the back pages to accounts of crime or political controversies, but will headline on the front pages the proclamation of a new scientific hypothesis.Progress along such lines will be impossible while nations persist in the savage practice of killing each other off. I inherited from my father, an erudite man who labored hard for peace, an ineradicable hatred of war.Even those who do not, or cannot, avail themselves of a scientific education, choose to benefit from the technology that is made possible by the scientific education of others.Individuals are not stable things, they are fleeting. Chromosomes too are shuffled into oblivion, like hands of cards soon after they are dealt. But the cards themselves survive the shuffling. The cards are the genes. The genes are not destroyed by crossing-over, they merely change partners and march on. Of course they march on. That is their business. They are the replicators and we are their survival machines. When we have served our purpose we are cast aside. But genes are denizens of geological time: genes are forever.Here lies one from a distant star, but the soil is not alien to him, for in death he belongs to the universe.If you don\\'t understand how somethingworks, never mind: just give up and say God did it. You don\\'tknow how the nerve impulse works? Good! You don\\'t understandhow memories are laid down in the brain? Excellent! Is photosynthesisa bafflingly complex process? Wonderful! Please don\\'t goto work on the problem, just give up, and appeal to God.Most institutions demand unqualified faith; but the institution of science makes skepticism a virtue.Mathematics is the cheapest science. Unlike physics or chemistry, it does not require any expensive equipment. All one needs for mathematics is a pencil and paper.For every fact there is an infinity of hypotheses. What goes up must come down.Maybe you who condemn me are in greater fear than I who am condemned.Progress is born of doubt and inquiry. The Church never doubts, never inquires. To doubt is heresy, to inquire is to admit that you do not know—the Church does neither.National boundaries are not evident when we view the Earth from space. Fanatical ethnic or religious or national chauvinisms are a little difficult to maintain when we see our planet as a fragile blue crescent fading to become an inconspicuous point of light against the bastion and citadel of the stars.We know enough at this moment to say that the God of Abraham is not only unworthy of the immensity of creation; he is unworthy even of man.A scientist can pretend that his work isn\\'t himself, it\\'s merely the impersonal truth. An artist can\\'t hide behind the truth. He can\\'t hide anywhere.I have something that I call my Golden Rule. It goes something like this: \\'Do unto others twenty-five percent better than you expect them to do unto you.\\' … The twenty-five percent is for error.It takes a fearless, unflinching love and deep humility to accept the universe as it is. The most effective way he knew to accomplish that, the most powerful tool at his disposal, was the scientific method, which over time winnows out deception. It can\\'t give you absolute truth because science is a permanent revolution, always subject to revision, but it can give you successive approximations of reality.When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.Science is based on experiment, on a willingness to challenge old dogma, on an openness to see the universe as it really is. Accordingly, science sometimes requires courage - at the very least the courage to question the conventional wisdom.الكيمياء والطبيعة والكهرباء هي العلوم الصغيرة. والدين هو العلم الكبير الذي يشتمل على كل العلوم في باطنه. ولا تعارض بين الدين والعلم ، لأن الدين في ذاته منتهى العلم المشتمل بالضرورة على جميع العلوم. والدين ضروري ومطلوب لأنه هو الذي يرسم للعلوم الصغيرة غاياتها وأهدافها ويضع لها وظائفها السليمة في إطار الحياة المثلى.. الدين هو الذي يقيم الضمير .. والضمير بدوره يختار للطاقة الذرية وظيفة بناءة.. ولا يلقي بها دمارا وموتا على الأبرياء..وهو الذي يهيب بنا أن نجعل من الكهرباء وسيلة إضاءة لا وسيلة للهلاك.If we wish to draw philosophical conclusions about our own existence, our significance, and the significance of the universe itself, our conclusions should be based on empirical knowledge. A truly open mind means forcing our imaginations to conform to the evidence of reality, and not vice versa, whether or not we like the implications.من أوجب الواجبات على الدولة أن تترك العلماء أحراراً في حكمهم على الأمور، أن تشعرهم باستقلالهم، لأنهم قادة الفكر، كما أن على العلماء أن يتمسكوا بهذا الاستقلال. فاستقلال العلم والعلماء شرط لابد منه لحياة العلم والفضيلة على حد سواء. وإذا ضاع استقلال العلم ضاع العلم وضاعت الفضيلة، بل وضاعت الأمة. وقد بقيت أوروبا ألف عام في ظلمات العصور الوسطى، لأن أمورهم كانت في أيدي قوم لا يؤمنون بالحق، ولا يؤمنون باستقلال العلم، فاضطهدوا العلماء، وحاربوا حرية الفكر، واتغمسوا في الجهالة محتمين وراء الجدل اللفظي الأجوف، فعم الظلم والضلال.People wrap themselves in their beliefs. And they do it in such a way that you can\\'t set them free. Not even the truth will set them free.Islam expect every Muslim to do this duty, and if we realise our responsibility time will come soon when we shall justify ourselves worthy of a glorious past.He who hears the rippling of rivers in these degenerate days will not utterly despair.There is a philosophy that says that if something is unobservable -- unobservable in principle -- it is not part of science. If there is no way to falsify or confirm a hypothesis, it belongs to the realm of metaphysical speculation, together with astrology and spiritualism. By that standard, most of the universe has no scientific reality -- it\\'s just a figment of our imaginations.For someone who\\'e smarter than a supercomputer, sometimes you\\'re a real idiot.We are here because one odd group of fishes had a peculiar fin anatomy that could transform into legs for terrestrial creatures; because the earth never froze entirely during an ice age; because a small and tenuous species, arising in Africa a quarter of a million years ago, has managed, so far, to survive by hook and by crook. We may yearn for a ‘higher answer’– but none existsSo my antagonist said, \"Is it impossible that there are flying saucers? Can you prove that it\\'s impossible?\" \"No\", I said, \"I can\\'t prove it\\'s impossible. It\\'s just very unlikely\". At that he said, \"You are very unscientific. If you can\\'t prove it impossible then how can you say that it\\'s unlikely?\" But that is the way that is scientific. It is scientific only to say what is more likely and what less likely, and not to be proving all the time the possible and impossible.knowledge, absolutely sure of its infallibility, is faithScience teaches to think but love teaches to smile.The truth of our faith becomes a matter of ridicule among the infidels if any Catholic, not gifted with the necessary scientific learning, presents as dogma what scientific scrutiny shows to be false.1. When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.2. The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.3. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.إن الطفرة العلمية القادمة مرهونة بنشأة جيل من العلماء ينظرون إلى قوانين الفيزياء الحديثة لا بكونها قوانين الطبيعة ولكن بكونها ظاهرة تحتاج إلى تفسير وفق قوانين جديدةWhen in doubt, C-4.Your beliefs don\\'t make you a better person, your behavior does.What does it matter? Science has achieved some wonderful things, of course, but I\\'d far rather be happy than right any day.Science is a way of trying not to fool yourself. The principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.When I heard the learn’d astronomer; When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me; When I was shown the charts and the diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them; When I, sitting, heard the astronomer, where he lectured with much applause in the\\tlecture-room, How soon, unaccountable, I became tired and sick;Till rising and gliding out, I wander’d off by myself, In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time, Look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.So long as the universe had a beginning, we could suppose it had a creator. But if the universe is really completely self-contained, having no boundary or edge, it would have neither beginning nor end: it would simply be. What place, then, for a creator?One of the strongest motives that lead men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness, from the fetters of one\\'s own ever-shifting desires. A finely tempered nature longs to escape from the personal life into the world of objective perception and thought.But recently I have learned from discussions with a variety of scientists and other non-philosophers (e.g., the scientists participating with me in the Sean Carroll workshop on the future of naturalism) that they lean the other way: free will, in their view, is obviously incompatible with naturalism, with determinism, and very likely incoherent against any background, so they cheerfully insist that of course they don\\'t have free will, couldn’t have free will, but so what? It has nothing to do with morality or the meaning of life. Their advice to me at the symposium was simple: recast my pressing question as whether naturalism (materialism, determinism, science...) has any implications for what we may call moral competence. For instance, does neuroscience show that we cannot be responsible for our choices, cannot justifiably be praised or blamed, rewarded or punished? Abandon the term \\'free will\\' to the libertarians and other incompatibilists, who can pursue their fantasies untroubled. Note that this is not a dismissal of the important issues; it’s a proposal about which camp gets to use, and define, the term. I am beginning to appreciate the benefits of discarding the term \\'free will\\' altogether, but that course too involves a lot of heavy lifting, if one is to avoid being misunderstood.Almost everything that distinguishes the modern world from earlier centuries is attibutable to science, which achieved its most spectacular triumphs in the seventeenth century.It is not the possession of truth, but the success which attends the seeking after it, that enriches the seeker and brings happiness to him.And although I have seen nothing but black crows in my life, it doesn\\'t mean that there\\'s no such thing as a white crow. Both for a philosopher and for a scientist it can be important not to reject the possibility of finding a white crow. You might almost say that hunting for \\'the white crow\\' is science\\'s principal task.Sadly, my socks are like snowflakes, no two are exactly alike.If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find no such case.The real question is not whether machines think but whether men do. The mystery which surrounds a thinking machine already surrounds a thinking man.No one will protect what they don\\'t care about; and no one will care about what they have never experienedThe aim of science is to discover and illuminate truth. And that, I take it, is the aim of literature, whether biography or history... It seems to me, then, that there can be no separate literature of science.I\\'m dark matter. The universe inside of me is full of something, and science can\\'t even shine a light on it. I feel like I\\'m mostly made of mysteries.My dream, is to dream, a dream.Everything existing in the universe is the fruit of chance and necessity.Instead of reality being passively recorded by the brain, it is actively constructed by it.To worship a sacred mystery was just to worship your own ignorance.The capacity to blunder slightly is the real marvel of DNA. Without this special attribute, we would still be anaerobic bacteria and there would be no music.Consider again that dot [Earth]. That\\'s here. That\\'s home. That\\'s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every \"superstar,\" every \"supreme leader,\" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there - on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.So the story of man runs in a dreary circle, because he is not yet master of the earth that holds him.To know the history of science is to recognize the mortality of any claim to universal truth. The Copenhagen Interpretation is sometimes called \"model agnosticism\" and holds that any grid we use to organize our experience of the world is a model of the world and should not be confused with the world itself. Alfred Korzybski, the semanticist, tried to popularize this outside physics with the slogan, \"The map is not the territory.\" Alan Watts, a talented exegete of Oriental philosophy, restated it more vividly as \"The menu is not the meal.Men love to wonder, and that is the seed of science....The Presidential election has given me less anxiety than I myself could have imagined. The next administration will be a troublesome one, to whomsoever it falls, and our John has been too much worn to contend much longer with conflicting factions. I call him our John, because, when you were at the Cul de sac at Paris, he appeared to me to be almost as much your boy as mine....As to the decision of your author, though I wish to see the book {Flourens’s Experiments on the functions of the nervous system in vertebrated animals}, I look upon it as a mere game at push-pin. Incision-knives will never discover the distinction between matter and spirit, or whether there is any or not. That there is an active principle of power in the universe, is apparent; but in what substance that active principle resides, is past our investigation. The faculties of our understanding are not adequate to penetrate the universe. Let us do our duty, which is to do as we would be done by; and that, one would think, could not be difficult, if we honestly aim at it.Your university is a noble employment in your old age, and your ardor for its success does you honor; but I do not approve of your sending to Europe for tutors and professors. I do believe there are sufficient scholars in America, to fill your professorships and tutorships with more active ingenuity and independent minds than you can bring from Europe. The Europeans are all deeply tainted with prejudices, both ecclesiastical and temporal, which they can never get rid of. They are all infected with episcopal and presbyterian creeds, and confessions of faith. They all believe that great Principle which has produced this boundless universe, Newton’s universe and Herschel’s universe, came down to this little ball, to be spit upon by Jews. And until this awful blasphemy is got rid of, there never will be any liberal science in the world.I salute your fireside with best wishes and best affections for their health, wealth and prosperity.{Letter to Thomas Jefferson, 22 January, 1825}What intrigued me more than anything else was finding out the way in which everything, all of creation - all of it! - was held together by invisible chemical bonds, and I found a strange, inexplicable comfort in knowing that somewhere, even though we couldn\\'t see it in our own world, there was a real stability.The TV scientist who mutters sadly, \"The experiment is a failure; we have failed to achieve what we had hoped for,\" is suffering mainly from a bad script writer. An experiment is never a failure solely because it fails to achieve predicted results. An experiment is a failure only when it also fails adequately to test the hypothesis in question, when the data it produces don\\'t prove anything one way or another.No Gods Or Kings. Only Man. -Andrew RyanHe saw that science had become as great a hoax as religion, that nationalism was a farce, patriotism a fraud, education a form of leprosy, and that morals were for cannibalsOm (AUM) the Divine song is at the same time Symmetry, Supersymmetry, broken Symmetry, and the unbroken Symmetry of Nature.Colour is a power which directly influences the soul.Any man could, if he were so inclined, be the sculptor of his own brain.It\\'s much easier on the emotions when one sees life as an experiment rather than a struggle for popularity.The universe is so unhuman, that is, it goes its way with so little thought of man. He is but an incident, not an end. We must adjust our notions to the discovery that things are not shaped to him, but that he is shaped to them. The air was not made for his lungs, but he has lungs because there is air; the light was not created for his eye, but he has eyes because there is light. All the forces of nature are going their own way; man avails himself of them, or catches a ride as best he can. If he keeps his seat, he prospers; if he misses his hold and falls, he is crushed.It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data.Faith is a fine inventionWhen gentlemen can see,But microscopes are prudentIn an emergency.The whole value of solitude depends upon oneself; it may be a sanctuary or a prison, a haven of repose or a place of punishment, a heaven or a hell, as we ourselves make it.I believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.A person who has been punished is not thereby simply less inclined to behave in a given way; at best, he learns how to avoid punishment.And what greater might do we possess as human beings than our capacity to question and to learn?I think that modern physics has definitely decided in favor of Plato. In fact the smallest units of matter are not physical objects in the ordinary sense; they are forms, ideas which can be expressed unambiguously only in mathematical language.Educators may bring upon themselves unnecessary travail by taking a tactless and unjustifiable position about the relation between scientific and religious narratives. We see this, of course, in the conflict concerning creation science. Some educators representing, as they think, the conscience of science act much like those legislators who in 1925 prohibited by law the teaching of evolution in Tennessee. In that case, anti-evolutionists were fearful that a scientific idea would undermine religious belief. Today, pro-evolutionists are fearful that a religious idea will undermine scientific belief. The former had insufficient confidence in religion; the latter insufficient confidence in science. The point is that profound but contradictory ideas may exist side by side, if they are constructed from different materials and methods and have different purposes. Each tells us something important about where we stand in the universe, and it is foolish to insist that they must despise each other.What we call rational grounds for our beliefs are often extremely irrational attempts to justify our instincts.DNA neither cares nor knows. DNA just is. And we dance to its music.A hundred years from now, people will look back on us and laugh. They\\'ll say, \\'You know what people used to believe? They believed in photons and electrons. Can you imagine anything so silly?\\' They\\'ll have a good laugh, because by then there will be newer better fantasies... And meanwhile, you feel the way the boat moves? That\\'s the sea. That\\'s real. You smell the salt in the air? You feel the sunlight on your skin? That\\'s all real. Life is wonderful. It\\'s a gift to be alive, to see the sun and breathe the air. And there isn\\'t really anything else.Science tells me God must exist.My mind tells me I\\'ll never understand God.My heart tells me I\\'m not meant to. [Vittoria Vetra]Science is the ultimate pornography, analytic activity whose main aim is to isolate objects or events from their contexts in time and space. This obsession with the specific activity of quantified functions is what science shares with pornography....a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention...We absolutely must leave room for doubt or there is no progress and there is no learning. There is no learning without having to pose a question. And a question requires doubt. People search for certainty. But there is no certainty. People are terrified — how can you live and not know? It is not odd at all. You only think you know, as a matter of fact. And most of your actions are based on incomplete knowledge and you really don\\'t know what it is all about, or what the purpose of the world is, or know a great deal of other things. It is possible to live and not know.The way to find out about our place in the universe is by examining the universe and by examining ourselves - without preconceptions, with as unbiased a mind as we can muster.The problem is, or rather one of the problems, for there are many, a sizeable proportion of which are continually clogging up the civil, commercial, and criminal courts in all areas of the Galaxy, and especially, where possible, the more corrupt ones, this.The previous sentence makes sense. That is not the problem.This is:Change.Read it through again and you\\'ll get it.[When a religious couple wrote to Sagan about fulfilled prophecies, he wrote back in May 1996:]If ‘fulfilled prophecy’ is your criterion, why do you not believe in materialistic science, which has an unparalleled record of fulfilled prophecy? Consider, for example, eclipses.Will we turn our backs on science because it is perceived as a threat to God, abandoning all the promise of advancing our understanding of nature and applying that to the alleviation of suffering and the betterment of humankind? Alternatively, will we turn our backs on faith, concluding that science has rendered the spiritual life no longer necessary, and that traditional religious symbols can now be replaced by engravings of the double helix on our alters?Both of these choices are profoundly dangerous. Both deny truth. Both will diminish the nobility of humankind. Both will be devastating to our future. And both are unnecessary. The God of the Bible is also the God of the genome. He can be worshipped in the cathedral or in the laboratory. His creation is majestic, awesome, intricate and beautiful - and it cannot be at war with itself. Only we imperfect humans can start such battles. And only we can end them.It was badly received by the generation to which it was first addressed, and the outpouring of angry nonsense to which it gave rise is sad to think upon. But the present generation will probably behave just as badly if another Darwin should arise, and inflict upon them that which the generality of mankind most hate—the necessity of revising their convictions. Let them, then, be charitable to us ancients; and if they behave no better than the men of my day to some new benefactor, let them recollect that, after all, our wrath did not come to much, and vented itself chiefly in the bad language of sanctimonious scolds. Let them as speedily perform a strategic right-about-face, and follow the truth wherever it leads.Those who are enslaved to their sects are not merely devoid of all sound knowledge, but they will not even stop to learn!In the world of the very small, where particle and wave aspects of reality are equally significant, things do not behave in any way that we can understand from our experience of the everyday world...all pictures are false, and there is no physical analogy we can make to understand what goes on inside atoms. Atoms behave like atoms, nothing else.Hey,The is a secret for greater self-control, the science points to one thing: the power of paying attention.The meaning of world is the separation of wish and fact.Science is observing truth in the light of head. Religion is observing truth in the light of heart. Humanity is using both the lights. And education is developing that humanity.My view is that if your philosophy is not unsettled daily then you are blind to all the universe has to offer.The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science. Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder, is as good as dead, and his eyes are dimmed (Albert Einstein)Science is what you know, philosophy is what you don\\'t knowEvery aspect of Nature reveals a deep mystery and touches our sense of wonder and awe. Those afraid of the universe as it really is, those who pretend to nonexistent knowledge and envision a Cosmos centered on human beings will prefer the fleeting comforts of superstition. They avoid rather than confront the world. But those with the courage to explore the weave and structure of the Cosmos, even where it differs profoundly from their wishes and prejudices, will penetrate its deepest mysteries.I believe in evidence. I believe in observation, measurement, and reasoning, confirmed by independent observers. I\\'ll believe anything, no matter how wild and ridiculous, if there is evidence for it. The wilder and more ridiculous something is, however, the firmer and more solid the evidence will have to be.But today our very survival depends on our ability to stay awake, to adjust to new ideas, to remain vigilant and to face the challenge of change. The large house in which we live demands that we transform this world-wide neighborhood into a world – wide brotherhood. Together we must learn to live as brothers or together we will be forced to perish as fools.We must work passionately and indefatigably to bridge the gulf between our scientific progress and our moral progress. One of the great problems of mankind is that we suffer from a poverty of the spirit which stands in glaring contrast to our scientific and technological abundance. The richer we have become materially, the poorer we have become morally and spiritually.We are biology. We are reminded of this at the beginning and the end, at birth and at death. In between we do what we can to forget.The easiest way to do anything is properly.The known is finite, the unknown infinite; intellectually we stand on an islet in the midst of an illimitable ocean of inexplicability. Our business in every generation is to reclaim a little more land, to add something to the extent and the solidity of our possessions. And even a cursory glance at the history of the biological sciences during the last quarter of a century is sufficient to justify the assertion, that the most potent instrument for the extension of the realm of natural knowledge which has come into men\\'s hands, since the publication of Newton\\'s ‘Principia’, is Darwin\\'s ‘Origin of Species.Something deeply hidden had to be behind things.Knock-knock-knockNo, that\\'s not creepy at all. Being in a spaceship twelve light-years from home and having someone knock on the door is totally normal.The glory of science is, that it is freeing the soul -- breaking the mental manacles -- getting the brain out of bondage -- giving courage to thought -- filling the world with mercy, justice, and joy.Reality is, you know, the tip of an iceberg of irrationality that we\\'ve managed to drag ourselves up onto for a few panting moments before we slip back into the sea of the unreal.There are few ways in which good people do more harm to those who take them seriously than to defend the gospel with arguments that won\\'t hold water. Many of the difficulties encountered by young people going to college would be avoided if parents and teachers were more careful to distinguish between what they know to be true and what they think may be true. Impetuous youth, upon finding the authority it trusts crumbling, even on unimportant details, is apt to lump everything together and throw the baby out with the bath.Beyond all sciences, philosophies, theologies, and histories, a child\\'s relentless inquiry is truly all it takes to remind us that we don\\'t know as much as we think we know.Emotional states are fairly quick bursts of neuronal gossip. Traits, on the other hand, are more like the neuronal equivalent of committed relationships.I am not afraid of a person who knows 10000 kicks. But I am afraid of a person who knows one kick but practices it for 10000 times.The biggest battle is the war against ignorance.In the battle that is philosophy all the techniques of war, including looting and camouflage, are permissible.Pick up a pinecone and count the spiral rows of scales. You may find eight spirals winding up to the left and 13 spirals winding up to the right, or 13 left and 21 right spirals, or other pairs of numbers. The striking fact is that these pairs of numbers are adjacent numbers in the famous Fibonacci series: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21... Here, each term is the sum of the previous two terms. The phenomenon is well known and called phyllotaxis. Many are the efforts of biologists to understand why pinecones, sunflowers, and many other plants exhibit this remarkable pattern. Organisms do the strangest things, but all these odd things need not reflect selection or historical accident. Some of the best efforts to understand phyllotaxis appeal to a form of self-organization. Paul Green, at Stanford, has argued persuasively that the Fibonacci series is just what one would expects as the simplest self-repeating pattern that can be generated by the particular growth processes in the growing tips of the tissues that form sunflowers, pinecones, and so forth. Like a snowflake and its sixfold symmetry, the pinecone and its phyllotaxis may be part of order for freeIn this single galaxy of ours there are eighty-seven thousand million suns. [...] In challenging it, you would be like ants attempting to label and classify all the grains of sand in all the deserts of the world. [...] It is a bitter thought, but you must face it. The planets you may one day possess. But the stars are not for man.We\\'re all a genius, but If you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.The gravitational waves of the first detection were generated by a collision of black holes in a galaxy 1.3 billion light-years away, and at a time when Earth was teeming with simple, single-celled organisms. While the ripple moved through space in all directions, Earth would, after another 800 million years, evolve complex life, including flowers and dinosaurs and flying creatures, as well as a branch of vertebrates called mammals. Among the mammals, a sub-branch would evolve frontal lobes and complex thought to accompany them. We call them primates. A single branch of these primates would develop a genetic mutation that allowed speech, and that branch—Homo Sapiens—would invent agriculture and civilization and philosophy and art and science. All in the last ten thousand years. Ultimately, one of its twentieth-century scientists would invent relativity out of his head, and predict the existence of gravitational waves. A century later, technology capable of seeing these waves would finally catch up with the prediction, just days before that gravity wave, which had been traveling for 1.3 billion years, washed over Earth and was detected.Yes, Einstein was a badass.The very foundation of science is to keep the door open to doubt.When I was 5 years old, my mom always told me that hap\\xadpi\\xadness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down “happyThe physician must be able to tell the antecedents, know the present, and foretell the future — must mediate these things, and have two special objects in view with regard to disease, namely, to do good or to do no harm.It would be better for us to have some doubts in an honest pursuit of truth, than it would be for us to be certain about something that was not true.\\tA little philosophy inclineth man\\'s mind to atheism, but depth in philosophy bringeth men\\'s minds about to religionIf you are searching for sacred knowledge and not just a palliative for your fears, then you will train yourself to be a good skeptic.For centuries the church has stood by while science picked away at religion bit by bit. Debunking miracles. Training the mind to overcome the heart. Condemning religion as the opiate of the masses. They denounce God as a hallucination - a delusional crutch for those too weak to accept that life is meaningless. I could not stand by while science presumed to harness the power of God himself! Proof, you say? Yes, proof of science\\'s ignorance! What is wrong with the admission that something exists beyond our understanding? The day science substantiates God in a lab is the day people stop needing faith!As cities grow and technology takes over the world belief and imagination fade away and so do we.Every great advance in science has issued from a new audacity of imagination. It is not my intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your skull.لا توجد أي دولة في العالم انطلقت في المجال التكنولوجي دون الاعتماد على اللغة الأم.Science, like life, feeds on its own decay. New facts burst old rules; then newly divined conceptions bind old and new together into a reconciling law.They keep saying that sea levels are rising an\\' all this. It\\'s nowt to do with the icebergs melting, it\\'s because there\\'s too many fish in it. Get rid of some of the fish and the water will drop. Simple. Basic science.You are a placebo responder. Your body plays tricks on your mind. You cannot be trusted.We ought not to ask why the human mind troubles to fathom the secrets of the universe. The diversity of the phenomena of nature is so great, and the treasures hidden in the skies so rich, precisely in order that the human mind shall never be lacking in fresh nourishment.Be sceptical, ask questions, demand proof. Demand evidence. Don\\'t take anything for granted. But here\\'s the thing: When you get proof, you need to accept the proof. And we\\'re not that good at doing that.It is difficult to say what is impossible, for the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow.If we long to believe that the stars rise and set for us, that we are the reason there is a Universe, does science do us a disservice in deflating our conceits?Einstein said that if quantum mechanics were correct then the world would be crazy. Einstein was right - the world is crazy.I esteem myself happy to have as great an ally as you in my search for truth. I will read your work ... all the more willingly because I have for many years been a partisan of the Copernican view because it reveals to me the causes of many natural phenomena that are entirely incomprehensible in the light of the generally accepted hypothesis. To refute the latter I have collected many proofs, but I do not publish them, because I am deterred by the fate of our teacher Copernicus who, although he had won immortal fame with a few, was ridiculed and condemned by countless people (for very great is the number of the stupid).{Letter to fellow revolutionary astronomer Johannes Kepelr}The labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.Philosophy and science have not always been friendly toward the idea of God, the reason being they are dedicated to the task of accounting for things and are impatient with anything that refuses to give an account of itself. The philosopher and the scientist will admit that there is much that they do not know; but that is quite another thing from admitting there is something which they can never know, which indeed they have no technique for discovering.The human race is just a chemical scum on a moderate-sized planet, orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies. We are so insignificant that I can\\'t believe the whole universe exists for our benefit. That would be like saying that you would disappear if I closed my eyes.Science is often misrepresented as ‘the body of knowledge acquired by performing replicated controlled experiments in the laboratory.’ Actually, science is something broader: the acquisition of reliable knowledge about the world.Every mystery ever solved had been a puzzle from the dawn of the human species right up until someone solved it.By looking far out into space we are also looking far back into time, back toward the horizon of the universe, back toward the epoch of the Big Bang.It\\'s the same with the wound in our hearts. We need to give them our attention so that they can heal. Otherwise the wounds continue to cause us pain. Sometimes for a very long time. We\\'re all going to get hurt. But here\\'s the trick - they also serve an amazing purpose. When our hearts are wounded that\\'s when they open.We grow through pain. We grow through difficult situations.That\\'s why you have to embrace each and every difficult thing in your life.Why, I can\\'t help wondering, is God thought to need such ferocious defence? One might have supposed him amply capable of looking after himself.We pledge to fight \\'blue-sky thinking wherever we find it. Life would be dull if we had to look up at cloudless monotony day after day.Without a constant misuse of language there cannot be any discovery, any progressBefore it is science and career, before it is livelihood, before even it is family or love, freedom is sound sleep and safety to notice the play of morning sun.I guess I\\'m just an old mad scientist at bottom. Give me an underground laboratory, half a dozen atom-smashers, and a beautiful girl in a diaphanous veil waiting to be turned into a chimpanzee, and I care not who writes the nation\\'s laws.[we see that] science is eminently perfectible, and that each theory has constantly to give way to a fresh one.Faith is always coveted most and needed most urgently where will is lacking; for will, as the affect of command, is the decisive sign of sovereignty and strength. In other words, the less one knows how to command, the more urgently one covets someone who commands, who commands severely—a god, prince, class, physician, father confessor, dogma, or party conscience. From this one might perhaps gather that the two world religions, Buddhism and Christianity, may have owed their origin and above all their sudden spread to a tremendous collapse and disease of the will. And that is what actually happened: both religions encountered a situation in which the will had become diseased, giving rise to a demand that had become utterly desperate for some \"thou shalt.\" Both religions taught fanaticism in ages in which the will had become exhausted, and thus they offered innumerable people some support, a new possibility of willing, some delight in willing. For fanaticism is the only \"strength of the will\" that even the weak and insecure can be brought to attain, being a sort of hypnotism of the whole system of the senses and the intellect for the benefit of an excessive nourishment (hypertrophy) of a single point of view and feeling that henceforth becomes dominant— which the Christian calls his faith. Once a human being reaches the fundamental conviction that he must be commanded, he becomes \"a believer.\"Conversely, one could conceive of such a pleasure and power of self-determination, such a freedom of the will [ This conception of \"freedom of the will\" ( alias, autonomy) does not involve any belief in what Nietzsche called \"the superstition of free will\" in section 345 ( alias, the exemption of human actions from an otherwise universal determinism).] that the spirit would take leave of all faith and every wish for certainty, being practiced in maintaining himself on insubstantial ropes and possibilities and dancing even near abysses. Such a spirit would be the free spirit par excellence.Al-Qur\\'an is not a book of Science, ‘S-C-I-E-N-C-E’ but a book of Signs ‘S-I-G-N-SDark matter is love. It\\'s the attracting force.Science and technology multiply around us. To an increasing extent they dictate the languages in which we speak and think. Either we use those languages, or we remain mute.Monotony collapses time; novelty unfolds it. You can exercise daily and eat healthily and live a long life, while experiencing a short one. If you spend your life sitting in a cubicle and passing papers, one day is bound to blend unmemorably into the next - and disappear. That\\'s why it\\'s so important to change routines regularly, and take vacations to exotic locales, and have as many new experiences as possible that can serve to anchor our memories. Creating new memories stretches out psychological time, and lengthens our perception of our lives.God did not create man in his own image. Evidently, it was quite the other way about, which is the painless explanation for the profusion of gods and religions, and the fratricide both between and among faiths, that we see all about us and that has so retarded the development of civilization.And here is the point, about myself and my co-thinkers. Our belief is not a belief. Our principles are not a faith. We do not rely solely upon science and reason, because these are necessary rather than sufficient factors, but we distrust anything that contradicts science or outrages reason. We may differ on many things, but what we respect is free inquiry, openmindedness, and the pursuit of ideas for their own sake.There are no forbidden questions in science, no matters too sensitive or delicate to be probed, no sacred truths.But it so happens that everything on this planet is, ultimately, irrational; there is not, and cannot be, any reason for the causal connexion of things, if only because our use of the word \"reason\" already implies the idea of causal connexion. But, even if we avoid this fundamental difficulty, Hume said that causal connexion was not merely unprovable, but unthinkable; and, in shallower waters still, one cannot assign a true reason why water should flow down hill, or sugar taste sweet in the mouth. Attempts to explain these simple matters always progress into a learned lucidity, and on further analysis retire to a remote stronghold where every thing is irrational and unthinkable.If you cut off a man\\'s head, he dies. Why? Because it kills him. That is really the whole answer. Learned excursions into anatomy and physiology only beg the question; it does not explain why the heart is necessary to life to say that it is a vital organ. Yet that is exactly what is done, the trick that is played on every inquiring mind. Why cannot I see in the dark? Because light is necessary to sight. No confusion of that issue by talk of rods and cones, and optical centres, and foci, and lenses, and vibrations is very different to Edwin Arthwait\\'s treatment of the long-suffering English language.Knowledge is really confined to experience. The laws of Nature are, as Kant said, the laws of our minds, and, as Huxley said, the generalization of observed facts.It is, therefore, no argument against ceremonial magic to say that it is \"absurd\" to try to raise a thunderstorm by beating a drum; it is not even fair to say that you have tried the experiment, found it would not work, and so perceived it to be \"impossible.\" You might as well claim that, as you had taken paint and canvas, and not produced a Rembrandt, it was evident that the pictures attributed to his painting were really produced in quite a different way.You do not see why the skull of a parricide should help you to raise a dead man, as you do not see why the mercury in a thermometer should rise and fall, though you elaborately pretend that you do; and you could not raise a dead man by the aid of the skull of a parricide, just as you could not play the violin like Kreisler; though in the latter case you might modestly add that you thought you could learn.This is not the special pleading of a professed magician; it boils down to the advice not to judge subjects of which you are perfectly ignorant, and is to be found, stated in clearer and lovelier language, in the Essays of Thomas Henry Huxley. It is not clear that intelligence has any long-term survival value.A human being weighing 70 kilograms contains among other things:-45 litres of water-Enough chalk to whiten a chicken pen-Enough phosphorus for 2,200 matches-Enough fat to make approximately 70 bars of soap-Enough iron to make a two inch nail-Enough carbon for 9,000 pencil points-A spoonful of magnesiumI weigh more than 70 kilograms.And I remember a TV series called Cosmos. Carl Sagan would walk around on a set that was meant to look like space, speaking in large numbers. On one of the shows he sat in front of a tank full of all the substances human beings are made of. He stirred the tank with a stick wondering if he would be able to create life.He didn’t succeed.We can\\'t help it. Life looks for life.Creative people see Prometheus in a mirror, never Pandora.The measure of greatness in a scientific idea is the extent to which it stimulates thought and opens up new lines of research.The best way to avoid abuses is for the populace in general to be scientifically literate, to understand the implications of such investigations. In exchange for freedom of inquiry, scientists are obliged to explain their work. If science is considered a closed priesthood, too difficult and arcane for the average person to understand, the dangers of abuse are greater. But if science is a topic of general interest and concern - if both its delights and its social consequences are discussed regularly and competently in the schools, the press, and at the dinner table - we have greatly improved our prospects for learning how the world really is and for improving both it and us.Not only have you been lucky enough to be attached since time immemorial to a favored evolutionary line, but you have also been extremely- make that miraculously- fortunate in your personal ancestry. Consider the fact that for 3.8 billion years, a period of time older than the Earth\\'s mountains and rivers and oceans, everyone of your forbears on both sides has been attractive enough to find a mate, healthy enough to reproduce, and sufficiently blessed by fate and circumstances to live long enough to do so. Not one of your pertinent ancestors was squashed, devoured, drowned, starved, stranded, stuck fast, untimely wounded, or otherwise deflected from it\\'s life quest of delivering a tiny charge of genetic material to the right partner at the right moment in order to perpetuate the only possible sequence of hereditary combinations that could result - evetually, astoundingly, and all to briefly- in you.The mentally disturbed do not employ the Principle of Scientific Parsimony: the most simple theory to explain a given set of facts. They shoot for the baroque.The Theory of Evolution has more holes in it than a dam made out of Swiss cheese.The truth is more magical - in the best and most exciting sense of the word - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.Merely fact-minded sciences make merely fact-minded people.The gut is the seat of all feeling. Polluting the gut not only cripples your immune system, but also destroys your sense of empathy, the ability to identify with other humans. Bad bacteria in the gut creates neurological issues. Autism can be cured by detoxifying the bellies of young children. People who think that feelings come from the heart are wrong. The gut is where you feel the loss of a loved one first. It\\'s where you feel pain and a heavy bulk of your emotions. It\\'s the central base of your entire immune system. If your gut is loaded with negative bacteria, it affects your mind. Your heart is the seat of your conscience. If your mind is corrupted, it affects your conscience. The heart is the Sun. The gut is the Moon. The pineal gland is Neptune, and your brain and nervous system (5 senses) are Mercury. What affects the moon or sun affects the entire universe within. So, if you poison the gut, it affects your entire nervous system, your sense of reasoning, and your senses.The paper does not provide the exact number of penises eaten by ducks, but the author says there have been enough over the years to prompt the coining of a popular saying: \\'I better get home or the ducks will have something to eat.Gandhi, the greatest political genius of our time, has pointed the way. He was shown of what sacrifices people are capable once they have found the right way. His work for the liberation of India is a living testimony to the fact that a will governed by firm conviction is stronger than a seemingly invincible material power.Electricity was a reality in the universe when Moses led the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt. This is true of all natural laws; they have always existed but only when understood may they be used.Both for practical reasons and for mathematically verifiable moral reasons, authority and responsibility must be equal - else a balancing takes place as surely as current flows between points of unequal potential. To permit irresponsible authority is to sow disaster; to hold a man responsible for anything he does not control is to behave with blind idiocy. The unlimited democracies were unstable because their citizens were not responsible for the fashion in which they exerted their sovereign authority... other than through the tragic logic of history... No attempt was made to determine whether a voter was socially responsible to the extent of his literally unlimited authority. If he voted the impossible, the disastrous possible happened instead - and responsibility was then forced on him willy-nilly and destroyed both him and his foundationless temple.I think the discomfort that some people feel in going to the monkey cages at the zoo is a warning sign.These mysteries about how we evolved should not distract us from the indisputable fact that we did evolve.while the scientist sees everything that happens in one point of space, the poet feels everything that happens in one point of time.All that was required to measure the planet was a man with a stick and a brain. In other words, couple an intellect with some experimental apparatus and almost anything seems achievable.i really like reading booksPhilosophy will clip an Angel\\'s wings,Conquer all mysteries by rule and line,Empty the haunted air, and gnomèd mine—Unweave a rainbow, as it erewhile madeThe tender-person\\'d Lamia melt into a shadeBut we must not forget that all things in the world are connected with one another and depend on one another, and that we ourselves and all our thoughts are also a part of nature. It is utterly beyond our power to measure the changes of things by time. Quite the contrary, time is an abstraction, at which we arrive by means of the change of things; made because we are not restricted to any one definite measure, all being interconnected. A motion is termed uniform in which equal increments of space described correspond to equal increments of space described by some motion with which we form a comparison, as the rotation of the earth. A motion may, with respect to another motion, be uniform. But the question whether a motion is in itself uniform, is senseless. With just as little justice, also, may we speak of an “absolute timeSo, in the face of overwhelming odds, I\\'m left with only one option: I’m going to have to science the shit out of this.Religion makes people kill each other. Science supplies them with weapons.There are no gods, no nations, no money and no human rights, except in our collective imagination.Science is all about proving theories and understanding the universe. Science folds everything into neat logical well-explained packages. The fey are magical capricious illogical and unexplainable. Science cannot prove the existence of faeries so naturally we do not exist. That type of nonbelief is fatal to faries.Freaks become norms, and norms become extinct. Monster by monster, evolution advancedThere are many sources of spirituality; religion may be the most common, but it is by no means the only. Anything that generates a sense of awe may be a source of spirituality. Science does this in spades.So this is where all the vapid talk about the \\'soul\\' of the universe is actually headed. Once the hard-won principles of reason and science have been discredited, the world will not pass into the hands of credulous herbivores who keep crystals by their sides and swoon over the poems of Khalil Gibran. The \\'vacuum\\' will be invaded instead by determined fundamentalists of every stripe who already know the truth by means of revelation and who actually seek real and serious power in the here and now. One thinks of the painstaking, cloud-dispelling labor of British scientists from Isaac Newton to Joseph Priestley to Charles Darwin to Ernest Rutherford to Alan Turing and Francis Crick, much of it built upon the shoulders of Galileo and Copernicus, only to see it casually slandered by a moral and intellectual weakling from the usurping House of Hanover. An awful embarrassment awaits the British if they do not declare for a republic based on verifiable laws and principles, both political and scientific.The reappearance of the crescent moon after the new moon; the return of the Sun after a total eclipse, the rising of the Sun in the morning after its troublesome absence at night were noted by people around the world; these phenomena spoke to our ancestors of the possibility of surviving death. Up there in the skies was also a metaphor of immortality.We ought to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its antecedent state and as the cause of the state that is to follow. An intelligence knowing all the forces acting in nature at a given instant, as well as the momentary positions of all things in the universe, would be able to comprehend in one single formula the motions of the largest bodies as well as the lightest atoms in the world, provided that its intellect were sufficiently powerful to subject all data to analysis; to it nothing would be uncertain, the future as well as the past would be present to its eyes. The perfection that the human mind has been able to give to astronomy affords but a feeble outline of such an intelligence.The whole war between the atheist and the theist comes down to this: the atheist believes a \\'what\\' created the universe; the theist believes a \\'who\\' created the universe.I didn\\'t want a world in which I had to choose between blind human babies and tortured monkey ones. To be frank, that\\'s the sort of choice I expect science to protect me from, not give me.Geometry has two great treasures; one is the Theorem of Pythagoras; the other, the division of a line into extreme and mean ratio. The first we may compare to a measure of gold; the second we may name a precious jewel.First, anyone who seriously intends to become a philosophermust \"once in his life\" withdraw into himself and attempt,within himself, to overthrow and build anew all the sciencesthat, up to then, he has been accepting. Philosophy wisdom(sagesse) is the philosophizer\\'s quite personal affair. It mustarise as His wisdom, as his self-acquired knowledge tendingtoward universality, a knowledge for which he can answer fromthe beginning, and at each step, by virtue of his own absoluteinsights.In my experience, the most staunchly held views are based on ignorance or accepted dogma, not carefully considered accumulations of facts. The more you expose the intricacies and realtities of the situation, the less clear-cut things become.Never fire a laser at a mirror. The fossil record implies trial and error, the inability to anticipate the future, features inconsistent with a Great Designer (though not a Designer of a more remote and indirect temperament.)Every time you understand something, religion becomes less likely. Only with the discovery of the double helix and the ensuing genetic revolution have we had grounds for thinking that the powers held traditionally to be the exclusive property of the gods might one day be ours. . . .Science is not separate from politics. As much as I would like it to be a pure thing, existing only in some intellectual realm unsullied by human struggle, it will always be entangled with the world we live in.The thing is, it\\'s very dangerous to have a fixed idea. A person with a fixed idea will always find some way of convincing himself in the end that he is rightRevere those things beyond science which really matter and about which it is so difficult to speak.Many questions come to mind. How influenced by contemporary religions were many of the scholars who wrote the texts available today? How many scholars have simply assumed that males have always played the dominant role in leadership and creative invention and projected this assumption into their analysis of ancient cultures? Why do so many people educated in this century think of classical Greece as the first major culture when written language was in use and great cities built at least twenty-five centuries before that time? And perhaps most important, why is it continually inferred that the age of the \"pagan\" religions, the time of the worship of female deities (if mentioned at all), was dark and chaotic, mysterious and evil, without the light of order and reason that supposedly accompanied the later male religions, when it has been archaeologically confirmed that the earliest law, government, medicine, agriculture, architecture, metallurgy, wheeled vehicles, ceramics, textiles and written language were initially developed in societies that worshiped the Goddess? We may find ourselves wondering about the reasons for the lack of easily available information on societies who, for thousands of years, worshiped the ancient Creatress of the Universe.These are lines from my asteroid-impact novel, Regolith:Just because there are no laws against stupidity doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be punished.I haven’t faced rejection this brutal since I was single.He smelled trouble like a fart in the shower.If this was a kiss of gratitude, then she must have been very grateful.

We are going to turn the world upside down. Your science is going to be shown up for what it is, nothing more than a pleasant metaphor usefully extrapolated into the production of toys for healthy children. That\\'s what science is good for.It is not some meta-theory at whose feet every point of view from astrology to acupressure to channeling need be laid to have the hand of science announce thumbs up or thumbs down.Sorry for the delay,\" Vogel said. \"I was required to make a bomb.\\u200eIn modern physics, there is no such thing as \"nothing.\" Even in a perfect vacuum, pairs of virtual particles are constantly being created and destroyed. The existence of these particles is no mathematical fiction. Though they cannot be directly observed, the effects they create are quite real. The assumption that they exist leads to predictions that have been confirmed by experiment to a high degree of accuracy.It is not a matter of whether one is biased or not. It is really a question of which bias is the best bias with which to be biased.Bad times have a scientific value. These are occasions a good learner would not miss.There is no god, and that\\'s the simple truth. If every trace of any single religion were wiped out and nothing were passed on, it would never be created exactly that way again. There might be some other nonsense in its place, but not that exact nonsense. If all of science were wiped out, it would still be true and someone would find a way to figure it all out again.Nothing is too wonderful to be true if it be consistent with the laws of nature.أنت تجد في الشرق أحد اثنين .. تجد من يرفض العلم اكتفاء بالدين والقرآن .. و تجد من يرفض الدين اكتفاء و عبادة للعلم المادي و الوسائلالمادية .و كلا الاثنين سبب من أسباب النكبة الحضارية في المنطقة .. و كلاهمالم يفهم المعنى الحقيقي للدين و لا المعنى الحقيقي للعلم .In this world, perfection is an illusion. Reagrdless of all those who utter the contrary, this is the reality. Obviously mediocre fools will forever lust for perfection and seek it out. However, what meaning is there in perfection? None. Not a bit. ...After perfection there exists nothing higher. Not even room for creation which means there is no room for wisdom or talent either. Understand? To scientists like ourselves, perfection is despair. - Kurotsuchi Mayuri (Bleach 306)Human beings are ultimately nothing but carriers-passageways- for genes. They ride us into the ground like racehorses from generation to generation. Genes don\\'t think about what constitutes good or evil. They don\\'t care whether we are happy or unhappy. We\\'re just means to an end for them. The only thing they think about is what is most efficient for them.Once we lose our fear of being tiny, we find ourselves on the threshold of a vast and awesome Universe which dwarfs -- in time, in space, and in potential -- the tidy anthropocentric proscenium of our ancestors.For instance? Well, for instance, what it means to be a man. In a city. In a century. In transition. In a mass. Transformed by science. Under organized power. Subject to tremendous controls. In a condition caused by mechanization. After the late failure of radical hopes. In a society that was no community and devalued the person. Owing to the multiplied power of numbers which made the self negligible. Which spent military billions against foreign enemies but would not pay for order at home. Which permitted savagery and barbarism in its own great cities. At the same time, the pressure of human millions who have discovered what concerted efforts and thoughts can do. As megatons of water shape organisms on the ocean floor. As tides polish stones. As winds hollow cliffs. The beautiful supermachinery opening a new life for innumerable mankind. Would you deny them the right to exist? Would you ask them to labor and go hungry while you yourself enjoyed old-fashioned Values? You—you yourself are a child of this mass and a brother to all the rest. or else an ingrate, dilettante, idiot. There, Herzog, thought Herzog, since you ask for the instance, is the way it runs.Physical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of Homer . . . For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer\\'s gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as cultural posits.There is a certain seductiveness about dead things. You can ill treat, alter and recolour what\\'s dead. It won’t complain. Words, too, have genuine substance -- mass and weight and specific gravity.It\\'s a most peculiar psychology—this business of \\'Science is based on faith too, so there!\\' Typically this is said by people who claim that faith is a good thing. Then why do they say \\'Science is based on faith too!\\' in that angry-triumphal tone, rather than as a compliment? And a rather dangerous compliment to give, one would think, from their perspective. If science is based on \\'faith\\', then science is of the same kind as religion—directly comparable. If science is a religion, it is the religion that heals the sick and reveals the secrets of the stars. It would make sense to say, \\'The priests of science can blatantly, publicly, verifiably walk on the Moon as a faith-based miracle, and your priests\\' faith can\\'t do the same.\\' Are you sure you wish to go there, oh faithist? Perhaps, on further reflection, you would prefer to retract this whole business of \\'Science is a religion too!We are not born into the world. We are born into something that we make into the world.Its the fate of all creators: They fall in love with their creations.The science, the art, the jurisprudence, the chief political and social theories, of the modern world have grown out of Greece and Rome—not by favour of, but in the teeth of, the fundamental teachings of early Christianity, to which science, art, and any serious occupation with the things of this world were alike despicable.It was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you.[Recalling in 1936 the discovery of the nucleus in 1909, when some alpha particles were observed instead of travelling through a very thin gold foil were seen to rebound backward, as if striking something much more massive than the particles themselves. He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this discovery.]All killer whales are named Kevin. You knew that, right?Indubitably, Magick is one of the subtlest and most difficult of the sciences and arts. There is more opportunity for errors of comprehension, judgement and practice than in any other branch of physics.Science doesn\\'t tell us what we should do. It only tells us what is.There are no foolish questions and no man becomes a fool until he has stopped asking questions.Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve....there\\'s something in science like the shine of the Patronus Charm, driving back all sorts of darkness and madness...The best scientist is open to experience and begins with romance - the idea that anything is possible.Order is heaven\\'s first law.He wrested the world\\'s whereabouts from the stars, and locked the secret in a pocket watch.The secrets of evolution, are time and death. There\\'s an unbroken thread that stretches from those first cells to us.If you\\'ve done 6 impossible things this morning, why not round it off with breakfast at Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe?...\"Nature\" is not to be understood as that which is just present-at-hand, nor as the power of Nature. The wood is a forest of timber, the mountain a quarry of rock; the river is water-power, the wind is wind \\'in the sails\\'. As the \\'environment\\' is discovered, the \\'Nature\\' thus discovered is encountered too. If its kind of Being as ready-to-hand is disregarded, this \\'Nature\\' itself can be discovered and defined simply in its pure presence-at-hand. But when this happens, the Nature which \\'stirs and strives\\', which assails us and enthralls us as landscape, remains hidden. The botanist\\'s plants are not the flowers of the hedgerow; the \\'source\\' which the geographer establishes for a river is not the \\'springhead in the dale\\'.This is the concentration camp and crematorium at Auschwitz. This is where people were turned into numbers. Into this pond were flushed the ashes of some four million people. And that was not done by gas. It was done by arrogance. It was done by dogma. It was done by ignorance. When people believe that they have absolute knowledge, with no test in reality, this is how they behave.Religion has always persecuted science.Not too long ago thousands spent their lives as recluses to find spiritual vision in the solitude of nature. Modern man need not become a hermit to achieve this goal, for it is neither ecstasy nor world-estranged mysticism his era demands, but a balance between quantitative and qualitative reality. Modern man, with his reduced capacity for intuitive perception, is unlikely to benefit from the contemplative life of a hermit in the wilderness. But what he can do is to give undivided attention, at times, to a natural phenomenon, observing it in detail, and recalling all the scientific facts about it he may remember. Gradually, however, he must silence his thoughts and, for moments at least, forget all his personal cares and desires, until nothing remains in his soul but awe for the miracle before him. Such efforts are like journeys beyond the boundaries of narrow self-love and, although the process of intuitive awakening is laborious and slow, its rewards are noticeable from the very first. If pursued through the course of years, something will begin to stir in the human soul, a sense of kinship with the forces of life consciousness which rule the world of plants and animals, and with the powers which determine the laws of matter. While analytical intellect may well be called the most precious fruit of the Modern Age, it must not be allowed to rule supreme in matters of cognition. If science is to bring happiness and real progress to the world, it needs the warmth of man\\'s heart just as much as the cold inquisitiveness of his brain.We shall never achieve harmony with the land, anymore than we shall achieve absolute justice or liberty for people. In these higher aspirations the important thing is not to achieve but to strive.The curious mind embraces science; the gifted and sensitive, the arts; the practical, business; the leftover becomes an economistBut now science is the belief system that is hundreds of years old. And, like the medieval system before it, science is starting not to fit the world any more. Science has attained so much power that its practical limits begin to be apparent. Largely through science, billions of us live in one small world, densely packed and intercommunicating. But science cannot help us decide what to do with that world, or how to live. Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it cannot tell us not to build it. Science can make pesticide, but cannot tell us not to use it. And our world starts to seem polluted in fundamental ways---air, and water, and land---because of ungovernable science.Man moves in a world that is nothing more or less than his consciousness objectified.–Neville GoddardStop telling God what to do with his dice.To ride a bicycle is in itself some protection against superstitious fears, since the bicycle is the product of pure reason applied to motion. Geometry at the service of man! Give me two spheres and a straight line and I will show you how far I can take them. Voltaire himself might have invented the bicycle, since it contributes so much to man’s welfare and nothing at all to his bane. Beneficial to the health, it emits no harmful fumes and permits only the most decorous speeds. How can a bicycle ever be an implement of harm?The essence of science is that it is always willing to abandon a given idea for a better one; the essence of theology is that it holds its truths to be eternal and immutable.One planet, one experiment.Scientific principles and laws do not lie on the surface of nature. They are hidden, and must be wrested from nature by an active and elaborate technique of inquiry. I await your sentence with less fear than you pass it. The time will come when all will see what I see.Skepticism is the agent of reason against organized irrationalism--and is therefore one of the keys to human social and civic decency.The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function.Big whirls have little whirls,That feed on their velocity;And little whirls have lesser whirls,And so on to viscosity.People look down on stuff like geography and meteorology, and not only because they\\'re standing on one and being soaked by the other. They don\\'t look quite like real science. But geography is only physics slowed down and with a few trees stuck on it, and meteorology is full of excitingly fashionable chaos and complexity. And summer isn\\'t a time. It\\'s a place as well. Summer is a moving creature and likes to go south for the winter.Since the beginning of time, spirituality and religion have been called to fill in the gaps that science did not understand.In a manner of speaking. As we intend for you to found a dynasty. And that dynasty will rule society until it has progressed enough to-\"\"Overthrow the dynasty in a revolutionary, blood filled coup!\" Iggy said eagerly.We all looked at him.\"Just saying.\" He sheepishly took a bite of cookie.Science is the topography of ignorance.Science Fiction: Any scientific acclaim that omits God.Extinguished theologians lie about the cradle of every science as the strangled snakes beside that of Hercules; and history records that whenever science and orthodoxy have been fairly opposed, the latter has been forced to retire from the lists, bleeding and crushed if not annihilated; scotched, if not slain.Nothing is more humbling than to look with a strong magnifying glass at an insect so tiny that the naked eye sees only the barest speck and to discover that nevertheless it is sculpted and articulated and striped with the same care and imagination as a zebra. Apparently it does not occur to nature whether or not a creature is within our range of vision, and the suspicion arises that even the zebra was not designed for our benefit.It is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labour of calculation which could safely be relegated to anyone else if machines were used.(Describing, in 1685, the value to astronomers of the hand-cranked calculating machine he had invented in 1673.)…Our sunsets have been reduced to wavelengths and frequencies. The complexities of the universe have been shredded into mathematical equations. Even our self-worth as human beings has been destroyed.I feel very strongly indeed that a Cambridge education for our scientists should include some contact with the humanistic side. The gift of expression is important to them as scientists; the best research is wasted when it is extremely difficult to discover what it is all about ... It is even more important when scientists are called upon to play their part in the world of affairs, as is happening to an increasing extent.Please don\\'t die.Ares always reemerges from the chaos. It will never go away. Athenian civilization defends itself from the forces of Ares with metis, or technology. Technology is built on science. Science is like the alchemists\\' uroburos, continually eating its own tail. The process of science doesn\\'t work unless young scientists have the freedom to attack and tear down old dogmas, to engage in an ongoing Titanomachia. Science flourishes where art and free speech flourish.A science that hesitates to forget its founders is lost.Perhaps eggs are like neurons, which also are not replenished in adulthood: they know too much. Eggs must plan the party. Sperm need only to show up- wearing top hat and tails, of course. I predict we will abolish suffering throughout the living world. Our descendants will be animated by gradients of genetically pre-programmed well-being that are orders of magnitude richer than today\\'s peak experiences.En un mot, pour tirer la loi de l\\'expérience, if faut généraliser; c\\'est une nécessité qui s\\'impose à l\\'observateur le plus circonspect.In one word, to draw the rule from experience, one must generalize; this is a necessity that imposes itself on the most circumspect observer.The significant problems we have cannot be solved at the same level of thinking with which we created them.Science must not impose any philosophy, any more than the telephone must tell us what to say.The split in America, rather than simply economic, is between those who embrace reason, who function in the real world of cause and effect, and those who, numbed by isolation and despair, now seek meaning in a mythical world of intuition, a world that is no longer reality-based, a world of magic.Is it more probable that nature should go out of her course or that a man should tell a lie? We have never seen, in our time, nature go out of her course. But we have good reason to believe that millions of lies have been told in the same time. It is therefore at least millions to one that the reporter of a miracle tells a lie.\\tI will tell you why we have these extraordinary minds and souls, Miss Whittaker,\" he continued, as though he had not heard her. \"We have them because there is a supreme intelligence in the universe, which wishes for communion with us. This supreme intelligence longs to be known. It calls out to us. It draws us close to its mystery, and grants us these remarkable minds, in order that we try to reach for it. It wants us to find it. It wants union with us, more than anything.Do those people who hold up the Bible as an inspiration tomoral rectitude have the slightest notion of what is actually writtenin it?Economics was like psychology, a pseudoscience trying to hide that fact with intense theoretical hyperelaboration. And gross domestic product was one of those unfortunate measurement concepts, like inches or the British thermal unit, that ought to have been retired long before.It is also worth noting that one can obtain a Ph.D. in any branch of science for no other purpose than to make cynical use of scientific language in an effort to rationalize the glaring inadequacies of tbe Bible. A handful of Christians appear to have done this; some have even obtained their degrees from reputable universities. No doubt, others will follow in their footsteps. While such people are technically \"scientists,\" they are not behaving like scientists. They simply are not engaged in an honest inquiry into the nature of the universe. And their proclamations about God and the failures of Darwinism do not in the least signify that there is a legitimate scientific controversy about evolution.In metric, one milliliter of water occupies one cubic centimeter, weighs one gram, and requires one calorie of energy to heat up by one degree centigrade—which is 1 percent of the difference between its freezing point and its boiling point. An amount of hydrogen weighing the same amount has exactly one mole of atoms in it. Whereas in the American system, the answer to ‘How much energy does it take to boil a room-temperature gallon of water?’ is ‘Go fuck yourself,’ because you can’t directly relate any of those quantities.No one infers a god from the simple, from the known, from what is understood, but from the complex, from the unknown, and incomprehensible. Our ignorance is God; what we know is science.The very nature of the quantum theory ... forces us to regard the space-time coordination and the claim of causality, the union of which characterizes the classical theories, as complementary but exclusive features of the description, symbolizing the idealization of observation and description, respectively.He who replies to words of doubtdoth put the light of knowledge out.If a book were written all in numbers, it would be true. It would be just. Nothing said in words ever came out quite even. Things in words got twisted and ran together, instead of staying straight and fitting together. But underneath the words, at the center, like the center of the Square, it all came out even. Everything could change, yet nothing would be lost. If you saw the numbers you could see that, the balance, the pattern. You saw the foundations of the world. And they were solid.If only the scientific experts could come up with something to get it out of our minds. One cup of fixit fizzle that will lift the dirt from our lives, soften our hardness, protect our inner parts, improve our processing, reduce our yellowing and wrinkling, improve our natural color, and make us sweet and good.Lord, grant that my work increase knowledge and help other men. Failing that, Lord, grant that it will not lead to man’s destruction. Failing that, Lord, grant that my article in Brain be published before the destruction takes place.Within sixty-minute limits or one-hundred-yard limits or the limits of a game board, we can look for perfect moments or perfect structures. In my fiction I think this search sometimes turns out to be a cruel delusion.No optimism, no pessimism. No homesickness for lost values or for the way fiction used to be written. Everybody seems to know everything. Subjects surface and are totally exhausted in a matter of days or weeks, totally played out by the publishing industry and the broadcast industry. Nothing is too arcane to escape the treatment, the process. Making things difficult for the reader is less an attack on the reader than it is on the age and its facile knowledge-market. The writer is the person who stands outside society, independent of affiliation and independent of influence. The writer is the man or woman who automatically takes a stance against his or her government. There are so many temptations for American writers to become part of the system and part of the structure that now, more than ever, we have to resist. American writers ought to stand and live in the margins, and be more dangerous. Writers in repressive societies are considered dangerous. That’s why so many of them are in jail.Some people prefer to believe in conspiracy because they are made anxious by random acts. Believing in conspiracy is almost comforting because, in a sense, a conspiracy is a story we tell each other to ward off the dread of chaotic and random acts. Conspiracy offers coherence.I see contemporary violence as a kind of sardonic response to the promise of consumer fulfillment in America... I see this desperation against the backdrop of brightly colored packages and products and consumer happiness and every promise that American life makes day by day and minute by minute everywhere we go. Discarded pages mark the physical dimensions of a writer’s labor. Film allows us to examine ourselves in ways earlier societies could not—examine ourselves, imitate ourselves, extend ourselves, reshape our reality. It permeates our lives, this double vision, and also detaches us, turns some of us into actors doing walk-throughs. Every new novel stretches the term of the contract—let me live long enough to do one more book.You become a serious novelist by living long enough.Nothing great is ever accomplished by following standards.You will never get to the irreducible definition of anything because you will never be able to explain why you want to explain, and so on. The system will gobble itself up.The alternative to thinking in evolutionary terms is not to think at all.We are the intelligent elite among animal life on earth and whatever our mistakes, [Earth] needs us. This may seem an odd statement after all that I have said about the way 20th century humans became almost a planetary disease organism. But it has taken [Earth] 2.5 billion years to evolve an animal that can think and communicate its thoughts. If we become extinct she has little chance of evolving another.So those who wished for some central cosmic purpose for us, or at least our world, or at least our solar system, or at least our galaxy, have been disappointed, progressively disappointed. The universe is not responsive to our ambitious expectations.Sex is not about reproduc-tion, gender is not about males and females, courtship is not aboutpersuasion, fashion is not about beauty, and love is not about affec-tion. Below the surface of every banality and cliche there lies irony,cynicism, and profundity.Our craving for generality has [as one] source … our preoccupation with the method of science. I mean the method of reducing the explanation of natural phenomena to the smallest possible number of primitive natural laws; and, in mathematics, of unifying the treatment of different topics by using a generalization. Philosophers constantly see the method of science before their eyes, and are irresistibly tempted to ask and answer in the way science does. This tendency is the real source of metaphysics, and leads the philosopher into complete darkness. I want to say here that it can never be our job to reduce anything to anything, or to explain anything. Philosophy really is “purely descriptive.In conclusion, it appears that nothing can be more improving to a young naturalist, than a journey in distant countries.The history of man is simply the history of slavery, of injustice and brutality, together with the means by which he has, through the dead and desolate years, slowly and painfully advanced. He has been the sport and prey of priest and king, the food of superstition and cruel might. Crowned force has governed ignorance through fear. Hypocrisy and tyranny—two vultures—have fed upon the liberties of man. From all these there has been, and is, but one means of escape—intellectual development. Upon the back of industry has been the whip. Upon the brain have been the fetters of superstition. Nothing has been left undone by the enemies of freedom. Every art and artifice, every cruelty and outrage has been practiced and perpetrated to destroy the rights of man. In this great struggle every crime has been rewarded and every virtue has been punished. Reading, writing, thinking and investigating have all been crimes.Every science has been an outcast.All the altars and all the thrones united to arrest the forward march of the human race. The king said that mankind must not work for themselves. The priest said that mankind must not think for themselves. One forged chains for the hands, the other for the soul. Under this infamous regime the eagle of the human intellect was for ages a slimy serpent of hypocrisy.The human race was imprisoned. Through some of the prison bars came a few struggling rays of light. Against these bars Science pressed its pale and thoughtful face, wooed by the holy dawn of human advancement. Bar after bar was broken away. A few grand men escaped and devoted their lives to the liberation of their fellows.In 1494, King Charles VIII of France invaded Italy. Within months, his army collapsed and fled. It was routed not by the Italian army but by a microbe. A mysterious new disease spread through sex killed many of Charles’s soldiers and left survivors weak and disfigured. French soldiers spread the disease across much of Europe, and then it moved into Africa and Asia. Many called it the French disease. The French called it the Italian disease. Arabs called it the Christian disease. Today, it is called syphilis.Science, like art, is not a copy of nature but a re-creation of her.If a theory purports to explain everything, then it is likely not explaining much at all.Some people look like they sound better than they actually sound, because they look confident and have good posture,\" once musician, a veteran of many auditions, says. \"Other people look awful when they play but sound great. Other people have that belabored look when they play, but you can\\'t hear it in the sound. There is always this dissonance between what you see and hear\" (p.251).We are the middle children of history. Born too late to explore earth, born too early to explore space.DNA is like a computer program but far, far more advanced than any software ever created.Numbers do not feel. Do not bleed or weep or hope. They do not know bravery or sacrifice. Love and allegiance. At the very apex of callousness, you will find only ones and zeros.Our great mistake in education is, as it seems to me, the worship of book-learning–the confusion of instruction and education. We strain the memory instead of cultivating the mind. The children in our elementary schools are wearied by the mechanical act of writing, and the interminable intricacies of spelling; they are oppressed by columns of dates, by lists of kings and places, which convey no definite idea to their minds, and have no near relation to their daily wants and occupations; while in our public schools the same unfortunate results are produced by the weary monotony of Latin and Greek grammar. We ought to follow exactly the opposite course with children–to give them a wholesome variety of mental food, and endeavor to cultivate their tastes, rather than to fill their minds with dry facts. The important thing is not so much that every child should be taught, as that every child should be given the wish to learn. What does it matter if the pupil know a little more or a little less? A boy who leaves school knowing much, but hating his lessons, will soon have forgotten almost all he ever learned; while another who had acquired a thirst for knowledge, even if he had learned little, would soon teach himself more than the first ever knew.Science without conscience is the soul\\'s perdition.Napoleon, when hearing about Laplace\\'s latest book, said, \\'M. Laplace, they tell me you have written this large book on the system of the universe, and have never even mentioned its creator.\\'Laplace responds, \\'Je n\\'avais pas besoin de cette hypothèse-là. (I had no need of that hypothesis.)Science is as corruptible a human activity as any other.A nation that can\\'t control its energy sources can\\'t control its future.All the tales of miracles, with which the Old and New Testament are filled, are fit only for impostors to preach and fools to believe.I do not like odd things until I can understand them.The European talks of progress because by the aid of a few scientific discoveries he has established a society which has mistaken comfort for civilisation.Names and attributes must be accommodated to the essence of things, and not the essence to the names, since things come first and names afterwards.For the admirable gift of himself, and for the magnificent service he renders humanity, what reward does our society offer the scientist? Have these servants of an idea the necessary means of work? Have they an assured existence, sheltered from care? The example of Pierre Curiee, and of others, shows that they have none of these things; and that more often, before they can secure possible working conditions, they have to exhaust their youth and their powers in daily anxieties. Our society, in which reigns an eager desire for riches and luxury, does not understand the value of science. It does not realize that science is a most precious part of its moral patrimony. Nor does it take sufficient cognizance of the fact that science is at the base of all the progress that lightens the burden of life and lessens its suffering. Neither public powers nor private generosity actually accord to science and to scientists the support and the subsidies indispensable to fully effective work.If the people of Europe had known as much of astronomy and geology when the bible was introduced among them, as they do now, there never could have been one believer in the doctrine of inspiration. If the writers of the various parts of the bible had known as much about the sciences as is now known by every intelligent man, the book never could have been written. It was produced by ignorance, and has been believed and defended by its author. It has lost power in the proportion that man has gained knowledge. A few years ago, this book was appealed to in the settlement of all scientific questions; but now, even the clergy confess that in such matters, it has ceased to speak with the voice of authority. For the establishment of facts, the word of man is now considered far better than the word of God. In the world of science, Jehovah was superseded by Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler. All that God told Moses, admitting the entire account to be true, is dust and ashes compared to the discoveries of Descartes, Laplace, and Humboldt. In matters of fact, the bible has ceased to be regarded as a standard. Science has succeeded in breaking the chains of theology. A few years ago, Science endeavored to show that it was not inconsistent with the bible. The tables have been turned, and now, Religion is endeavoring to prove that the bible is not inconsistent with Science. The standard has been changed.The assumption of an absolute determinism is the essential foundation of every scientific enquiry.It is our task, both in science and in society at large, to prove the conventional wisdom wrong and to make our unpredictable dreams come trueScience is a first-rate piece of furniture for a man\\'s upper chamber, if he has common sense on the ground floor.I will argue that every scrap of biological diversity is priceless, to be learned and cherished, and never to be surrendered without a struggle.After all, what else is scientific enquiry of any sort other than a controlled version of banging one\\'s head against the universe until something gives?[Patricia Greenfield] concluded that “every medium develops some cognitive skills at the expense of others.Be With Me In The Phases Of My Work Because My Brain Feels Like It Has Been Whipped And I Yearn To Make A Small Perfect Thing Which Will Live In Your Morning Like Curious Static Through A President\\'s Elegy Or A Nude Hunchback Acquiring A Tan On The Crowded Oily Beach. From the scientific view, the theory of karma may be a metaphysical assumption -- but it is no more so than the assumption that all of life is material and originated out of pure chancePsychology is sometimes called a new science. This is quite wrong. Psychology is, perhaps, the oldest science, and, unfortunately, in its most essential features a forgotten science.Nothing in the universe can travel at the speed of light, they say, forgetful of the shadow`s speed.Faced with an exciting question, science tended to provide the dullest possible answer.According to scientists, there are three stages of love: lust, attraction, and attachment. And, it turns out, each of the stages is orchestrated by chemicals—neurotransmitters—in the brain.As you might expect, lust is ruled by testosterone and estrogen.The second stage, attraction, is governed by dopamine and serotonin. When, for example, couples report feeling indescribably happy in each other’s presence, that’s dopamine, the pleasure hormone, doing its work.Taking cocaine fosters the same level of euphoria. In fact, scientists who study both the brains of new lovers and cocaine addicts are hard-pressed to tell the difference.The second chemical of the attraction phase is serotonin. When couples confess that they can’t stop thinking about each other, it’s because their serotonin level has dropped. People in love have the same low serotonin levels as people with OCD. The reason they can’t stop thinking about each other is that they are literally obsessed.Oxytocin and vasopressin control the third stage: attachment or long-term bonding. Oxytocin is released during orgasm and makes you feel closer to the person you’ve had sex with. It’s also released during childbirth and helps bond mother to child. Vasopressin is released postcoitally.Natasha knows these facts cold. Knowing them helped her get over Rob’s betrayal. So she knows: love is just chemicals and coincidence.So why does Daniel feel like something more?In God\\'s eyes, walking on water is no more miraculous than the ability of hemoglobin to bond with oxygen inside a red blood corpuscle.The history of astronomy is a history of receding horizons.In the conditions of modern life the rule is absolute, the race which does not value trained intelligence is doomed.If it hurts, do it more frequently, and bring the pain forward.Looking behind, I am lifted with gratitude. Looking forward, I am filled with vision. Looking upward, I am filled with strength. Looking within, I discover peace.Nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate, that there are no mysteries in nature, that our triumphs are complete and that there are no new worlds to conquer.It is a profound and necessary truth that the deep things in science are not found because they are useful; they are found because it was possible to find them.If you want to teach your children that they are the tools of God, you had better not teach them that they are God\\'s rifles, or we will have to stand firmly opposed to you: your doctrine has no glory, no special rights, no intrinsic and inalienable merit. If you insist on teaching your children false-hoods—that the Earth is flat, that \"Man\" is not a product of evolution by natural selection—then you must expect, at the very least, that those of us who have freedom of speech will feel free to describe your teachings as the spreading of falsehoods, and will attempt to demonstrate this to your children at our earliest opportunity. Our future well-being—the well-being of all of us on the planet—depends on the education of our descendants.This mindless tolerance, which places observable scientific facts, subject to proof, on the same level as unprovable supernatural fantasy, has played a major role in the resurgence of both anti-intellectualism and anti-rationalism.It is not what the man of science believes that distinguishes him, but how and why he believes it. His beliefs are tentative, not dogmatic; they are based on evidence, not on authority or intuition.Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.When things get too complicated, it sometimes makes sense to stop and wonder: Have I asked the right question?Myths, whether in written or visual form, serve a vital role of asking unanswerable questions and providing unquestionable answers. Most of us, most of the time, have a low tolerance for ambiguity and uncertainty. We want to reduce the cognitive dissonance of not knowing by filling the gaps with answers. Traditionally, religious myths have served that role, but today — the age of science — science fiction is our mythology.I think we have different value systems.\" —Arthur\"Well mine\\'s better.\" —FordToday the network of relationships linking the human race to itself and to the rest of the biosphere is so complex that all aspects affect all others to an extraordinary degree. Someone should be studying the whole system, however crudely that has to be done, because no gluing together of partial studies of a complex nonlinear system can give a good idea of the behavior of the whole. One of the great achievements of science has been, if not to make it impossible for intelligent people to be religious, then at least to make it possible for them not to be religious. We should not retreat from this accomplishment.Today something unusual happened; I was walking without even knowing, where I was going. I was smiling without any cause. I was just happy without reasons. I can tell you that birds do sing, leaves of trees, do dance, and it’s beautiful. I am, a complete nature boy! Maybe, I was fully satisfied that sunlight was falling on my cheek. I got the power to love myself, nature and rest of humankind. Cheers, Everyone!This was the scientific age, and people wanted to believe that their traditions were in line with the new era, but this was impossible if you thought that these myths should be understood literally. Hence the furor occasioned by The Origin of Species, published by Charles Darwin. The book was not intended as an attack on religion, but was a sober exploration of a scientific hypothesis. But because by this time people were reading the cosmogonies of Genesis as though they were factual, many Christians felt--and still feel--that the whole edifice of faith was in jeopardy. Creation stories had never been regarded as historically accurate; their purpose was therapeutic. But once you start reading Genesis as scientifically valid, you have bad science and bad religion.Scientists have power by virtue of the respect commanded by the discipline... We live with poets and politicians, preachers and philosophers. All have their ways of knowing, and all are valid in their proper domain. The world is too complex and interesting for one way to hold all the answers.You can get into a habit of thought in which you enjoy making fun of all those other people who don\\'t see things as clearly as you do. We have to guard carefully against it.Each religion makes scores of purportedly factual assertions about everything from the creation of the universe to the afterlife. But on what grounds can believers presume to know that these assertions are true? The reasons they give are various, but the ultimate justification for most religious people’s beliefs is a simple one: we believe what we believe because our holy scriptures say so. But how, then, do we know that our holy scriptures are factually accurate? Because the scriptures themselves say so. Theologians specialize in weaving elaborate webs of verbiage to avoid saying anything quite so bluntly, but this gem of circular reasoning really is the epistemological bottom line on which all \\'faith\\' is grounded. In the words of Pope John Paul II: \\'By the authority of his absolute transcendence, God who makes himself known is also the source of the credibility of what he reveals.\\' It goes without saying that this begs the question of whether the texts at issue really were authored or inspired by God, and on what grounds one knows this. \\'Faith\\' is not in fact a rejection of reason, but simply a lazy acceptance of bad reasons. \\'Faith\\' is the pseudo-justification that some people trot out when they want to make claims without the necessary evidence.But of course we never apply these lax standards of evidence to the claims made in the other fellow’s holy scriptures: when it comes to religions other than one’s own, religious people are as rational as everyone else. Only our own religion, whatever it may be, seems to merit some special dispensation from the general standards of evidence.And here, it seems to me, is the crux of the conflict between religion and science. Not the religious rejection of specific scientific theories (be it heliocentrism in the 17th century or evolutionary biology today); over time most religions do find some way to make peace with well-established science. Rather, the scientific worldview and the religious worldview come into conflict over a far more fundamental question: namely, what constitutes evidence.Science relies on publicly reproducible sense experience (that is, experiments and observations) combined with rational reflection on those empirical observations. Religious people acknowledge the validity of that method, but then claim to be in the possession of additional methods for obtaining reliable knowledge of factual matters — methods that go beyond the mere assessment of empirical evidence — such as intuition, revelation, or the reliance on sacred texts. But the trouble is this: What good reason do we have to believe that such methods work, in the sense of steering us systematically (even if not invariably) towards true beliefs rather than towards false ones? At least in the domains where we have been able to test these methods — astronomy, geology and history, for instance — they have not proven terribly reliable. Why should we expect them to work any better when we apply them to problems that are even more difficult, such as the fundamental nature of the universe?Last but not least, these non-empirical methods suffer from an insuperable logical problem: What should we do when different people’s intuitions or revelations conflict? How can we know which of the many purportedly sacred texts — whose assertions frequently contradict one another — are in fact sacred?Yes, yes, I see it all! — an enormous social activity, a mighty civilization, a profuseness of science, of art, of industry, of morality, and afterwords, when we have filled the world with industrial marvels, with great factories, with roads, museums and libraries, we shall fall exhausted at the foot of it all, and it will subsist — for whom? Was man made for science or was science made for man?It is the man of science, eager to have his every opinion regenerated, his every idea rationalized, by drinking at the fountain of fact, and devoting all the energies of his life to the cult of truth, not as he understands it, but as he does not yet understand it, that ought properly to be called a philosopher.There are no things man was not meant to know. There are, perhaps, things man is too dumb to figure out, but that\\'s a different problem.It is convenient for the old men to blame Eve. To insist we are damned because a country girl talked to the snake one afternoon long ago. Children must starve in Somalia for that, and old women be abandoned in our greatest cities. It’s why we will finally be thrown into the lakes of molten lead. Because she was confused by happiness that first time anyone said she was beautiful. Nevertheless, she must be the issue, so people won’t notice that rocks and galaxies, mathematics and rust are also created in His image.I am very much out of my element here. There are moments, listening to the conversations going on around me, when I feel I am going to lose my mind. Earlier today, I heard someone say the words, \"I felt at one with the divine source of creation.\" Mary Roach on a conducted tour of Hades. I had to fight the urge to push back my chair and start screaming: STAND BACK! ALL OF YOU! I\\'VE GOT AN ARTHUR FINDLAY BOX CUTTER! Instead, I quietly excused myself and went to the bar, to commune with spirits I know how to relate to.They are ill discoverers that think there is no land, when they can see nothing but sea.In a nutshell, the universe is 4% visible, 23% undetectable and 73% unimaginable. Welcome to the cosmos, full of mass you can measure but not manhandle, driven by a force you can infer but not explain.I walk up and down the rows. The heads look like rubber halloween masks. They also look like human heads, but my brain has no precedent for human heads on tables or in roasting pans or anywhere other than on top of a human bodies, and so I think it has chosen to interpret the sight in a more comforting manner. - Here we are at the rubber mask factory. Look at the nice men and woman working on the masks.Footnote: In 1998, a woman in Saline, Michigan received a patent for a Decorative Penile Wrap...The patent included three pages of drawings, including a penis wearing a ghost outfit, another in the robes of the Grim Reaper, and one dressed up to look like a snowman. Einstein has a feeling for the central order of things. He can detect it in the simplicity of natural laws. We may take it that he felt this simplicity very strongly and directly during his discovery of the theory of relativity. Admittedly, this is a far cry from the contents of religion. I don\\'t believe Einstein is tied to any religious tradition, and I rather think the idea of a personal God is entirely foreign to him.How do we change the way science is taught?Ask anybody how many teachers truly made a difference in their life, and you never come up with more than the fingers on one hand. You remember their names, you remember what they did, you remember how they moved in front of the classroom. You know why you remember them? Because they were passionate about the subject. You remember them because they lit a flame within you. They got you excited about a subject you didn\\'t previously care about, because they were excited about it themselves. That\\'s what turns people on to careers in science and engineering and mathematics. That\\'s what we need to promote. Put that in every classroom, and it will change the world.I am using the word theory as a scientist means it: a set of ideas so well established by observations and physical models that it is essentially indistinguishable from fact. That is different from the colloquial use that means \"guess.\" To a scientist, you can bet your life on a theory. Remember, gravity is \"just a theory\" too.We believe that it is possible for scientific work to gain some knowledge about the reality of the world, by means of which we can increase out power and in accordance with which we can arrange our life. If this belief is an illusion, then we are in the same position as you. But science has given us evidence by its numerous and important successes that it is no illusion.Perhaps the hopes I have confessed to are of an illusory nature, too. But I hold fast to one distinction. Apart from the fact that no penalty is imposed for not sharing them, my illusions are not, like religious ones, incapable of correction.The question is whether any civilization can wage relentless war on life without destroying itself, and without losing the right to be called civilized.Dans la nature rien ne se crée, rien ne se perd, tout change.In nature nothing is created, nothing is lost, everything changes.Science only goes so far, then comes God.- Noah Calhoun-Imagination has brought mankind through the Dark Ages to its present state of civilization. Imagination led Columbus to discover America. Imagination led Franklin to discover electricity. Imagination has given us the steam engine, the telephone, the talking-machine and the automobile, for these things had to be dreamed of before they became realities. So I believe that dreams - day dreams, you know, with your eyes wide open and your brain-machinery whizzing - are likely to lead to the betterment of the world. The imaginative child will become the imaginative man or woman most apt to create, to invent, and therefore to foster civilization.The aim of science is to seek the simplest explanations of complex facts. We are apt to fall into the error of thinking that the facts are simple because simplicity is the goal of our quest. The guiding motto in the life of every natural philosopher should be, \\'Seek simplicity and distrust it.Thus, as far as he is a scientific man, as far as he knows anything, he is a materialist; outside his science, in spheres about which he knows nothing, he translates his ignorance into Greek and calls it agnosticism.It is interesting to note how many of the great scientific discoveries begin as myths.Nobody is driven by abstractions like \\'seeking truth.We should never wait for science to give us permission to do the uncommon; if we do, then we are turning science into another religion.New scientific ideas never spring from a communal body, however organized, but rather from the head of an individually inspired researcher who struggles with his problems in lonely thought and unites all his thought on one single point which is his whole world for the moment.Science is the search for the truth--it is not a game in which one tries to beat his opponent, to do harm to others. We need to have the spirit of science in international affairs, to make the conduct of international affairs the effort to find the right solution, the just solution of international problems, and not an effort by each nation to get the better of other nations, to do harm to them when it is possible. I believe in morality, in justice, in humanitarianism.I maintain that the human mystery is incredibly demeaned by scientific reductionism, with its claim in promissory materialism to account eventually for all of the spiritual world in terms of patterns of neuronal activity. This belief must be classed as a superstition.... we have to recognize that we are spiritual beings with souls existing in a spiritual world as well as material beings with bodies and brains existing in a material world.[When asked by a student if he believes in any gods]Oh, no. Absolutely not... The biggest advantage to believing in God is you don\\'t have to understand anything, no physics, no biology. I wanted to understand.আধুনিক বিজ্ঞান মানুষকে দিয়েছে বেগ, কিন্তু কেড়ে নিয়েছে আবেগ। তাতে আছে গতির আনন্দ, নেই যতির আয়েস।I have no responsibility to live up to what others expect of me. That\\'s their mistake, not my failing.We long for permanence but everything in the known universe is transient. That’s a fact but one we fight.None of the people have any real interest in a science, who only begin to be enthusiastic about it when they themselves have made discoveries in it.For scientists, reality is not optional.A man craves ultimate truths. Every mortal mind, I think, is that way. But what is ultimate truth? It\\'s the end of the road, where there is no more mystery, no more hope. And no more questions to ask, since all the answers have been given. But there is no such place.The Universe is a labyrinth made of labyrinths. Each leads to another. And wherever we cannot go ourselves, we reach with mathematics. Out of mathematics we build wagons to carry us into the nonhuman realms of the world.Love is a chemical reaction,But it cannot be fully understood or defined by science.And though a body cannot exist without a soul,It too cannot be fully understood or defined by science.Love is the most powerful form of energy,But science cannot decipher its elements.Yet the best cure for a sick soul is love,But even the most advanced physicianCannot prescribe it as medicine.INCOMPLETE SCIENCE by Suzy KassemTo say that the first casualty of war is truth is to miss the rather more important point that a principal weapon of war is lies.On a plaque attached to the NASA deep space probe we [human beings] are described in symbols for the benefit of any aliens who might meet the spacecraft as “bilaterly symmetrical, sexually differentiated bipeds, located on one of the outer spiral arms of the Milky Way, capable of recognising the prime numbers and moved by one extraordinary quality that lasts longer than all our other urges—curiosity.Life is too short to be anything but happy. So kiss slowly. Love deeply. Forgive quickly. Take chances and never have regrets. Forget the past but remember what it taught you.Humans don’t have programming.The real difference is this: the Christian says that he has knowledge; the Agnostic admits that he has none; and yet the Christian accuses the Agnostic of arrogance, and asks him how he has the impudence to admit the limitations of his mind. To the Agnostic every fact is a torch, and by this light, and this light only, he walks.The Agnostic knows that the testimony of man is not sufficient to establish what is known as the miraculous. We would not believe to-day the testimony of millions to the effect that the dead had been raised. The church itself would be the first to attack such testimony. If we cannot believe those whom we know, why should we believe witnesses who have been dead thousands of years, and about whom we know nothing?The Agnostic takes the ground that human experience is the basis of morality. Consequently, it is of no importance who wrote the gospels, or who vouched or vouches for the genuineness of the miracles. In his scheme of life these things are utterly unimportant. He is satisfied that “the miraculousUs\" versus \"them\" is not in our genes. It is something we learn.Seni sama pentingnya dengan matematika. Seni memanusiakan manusia. Seni menciptakan rasa empatiIn very different ways, the possibility that the universe is teeming with life, and the opposite possibility that we are totally alone, are equally exciting. Either way, the urge to know more about the universe seems to me irresistible, and I cannot imagine that anybody of truly poetic sensibility could disagree.I am older than you. Believe me, there is no other way to live on earth. Men are not open to truth or reason. They cannot be reached by a rational argument. The mind is powerless against them. Yet we have to deal with them. If we want to accomplish anything, we have to deceive them into letting us accomplish it. Or force them. They understand nothing else. We cannot expect their support for any endeavor of the intellect, for any goal of the spirit. They are nothing but vicious animals. They are greedy, self-indulgent, predatory dollar-chasersI was like I was in science class: I was curious.The winds, the sea, and the moving tides are what they are. If there is wonder and beauty and majesty in them, science will discover these qualities... If there is poetry in my book about the sea, it is not because I deliberately put it there, but because no one could write truthfully about the sea and leave out the poetry.Temporis filia veritas; cui me obstetricari non pudet.Truth is the daughter of time, and I feel no shame in being her midwife.I used to measure the skies, now I measure the shadows of Earth.Although my mind was sky-bound, the shadow of my body lies here.[Epitaph he composed for himself a few months before he died]An experiment is a question which science poses to Nature and a measurement is the recording of Nature\\'s answer.[Flaubert] didn’t just hate the railway as such; he hated the way it flattered people with the illusion of progress. What was the point of scientific advance without moral advance? The railway would merely permit more people to move about, meet and be stupid together.If you see an antimatter version of yourself running towards you, think twice before embracing.See now the power of truth; the same experiment which at first glance seemed to show one thing, when more carefully examined, assures us of the contrary.I am one of those who think, like Nobel, that humanity will draw more good than evil from new discoveries.In every man, there is a child. In every woman, there is a mother. The scientific method,\" Thomas Henry Huxley once wrote, \"is nothing but the normal working of the human mind.\" That is to say, when the mind is working; that is to say further, when it is engaged in corrrecting its mistakes.Taking this point of view, we may conclude that science is not physics, biology, or chemistry--is not even a \"subject\"--but a moral imperative drawn from a larger narrative whose purpose is to give perspective, balance, and humility to learning.An ocean traveler has even more vividly the impression that the ocean is made of waves than that it is made of water.the mind is a neural computerSo one must be resigned to being a clock that measures the passage of time, now out of order, now repaired, and whose mechanism generates despair and love as soon as its maker sets it going? Are we to grow used to the idea that every man relives ancient torments, which are all the more profound because they grow comic with repetition? That human existence should repeat itself, well and good, but that it should repeat itself like a hackneyed tune, or a record a drunkard keeps playing as he feeds coins into the jukebox...Newton was not the first of the age of reason. He was the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians and Sumerians, the last great mind that looked out on the visible and intellectual world with the same eyes as those who began to build our intellectual inheritance rather less than 10,000 years ago.Medicine rests upon four pillars—philosophy, astronomy, alchemy, and ethics. The first pillar is the philosophical knowledge of earth and water; the second, astronomy, supplies its full understanding of that which is of fiery and airy nature; the third is an adequate explanation of the properties of all the four elements—that is to say, of the whole cosmos—and an introduction into the art of their transformations; and finally, the fourth shows the physician those virtues which must stay with him up until his death, and it should support and complete the three other pillars.Sure, at some level scientists know nanobots will destroy mankind. They just can\\'t resist seeing how it happens.There are some men who are counted great because they represent the actuality of their own age, and mirror it as it is. Such an one was Voltaire, of whom it was epigrammatically said: \\'he expressed everybody\\'s thoughts better than anyone.\\' But there are other men who attain greatness because they embody the potentiality of their own day and magically reflect the future. They express the thoughts which will be everybody\\'s two or three centuries after them. Such as one was Descartes.Current theories on the creation of the Universe state that, if it were created at all and didn\\'t just start, as it were, unofficially, it came to being between ten and twenty thousand million years ago. By the same token the earth itself is generally supposed to be about four and a half thousand million years old.These dates are incorrect.Medieval Jewish scholars put the date of the Creation at 3760BC. Greek Orthodox theologians put Creation as far back as 5508BC.These suggestions are also incorrect.Archbishop James Usher (1580-1656) published Annales Veteris et Novi Testamenti in 1654, which suggested that the Heaven and the Earth were created in 4004BC. One of his aides took the calculation further, and was able to announce triumphantly that the Earth was created on Sunday the 21st of October, 4004BC, at exactly 9.00 a.m., because God liked to get work done early in the morning while he was feeling fresh.This too was incorrect. By almost a quarter of an hour.The whole business with the fossilized dinosaur skeletons was a joke the paleontologists haven\\'t seen yet.I know LSD; I don\\'t need to take it anymore. Maybe when I die, like Aldous Huxley.Oh juventud nunca dejes de pensar...I have been in my bed for five weeks, oppressed with weakness and other infirmities from which my age, seventy four years, permits me not to hope release. Added to this (proh dolor! [O misery!]) the sight of my right eye — that eye whose labors (dare I say it) have had such glorious results — is for ever lost. That of the left, which was and is imperfect, is rendered null by continual weeping.The spirit is one of the most neglected parts of man by doctors and scientists around the world. Yet, it is as vital to our health as the heart and mind. It\\'s time for science to examine the many facets of the soul. The condition of our soul is usually the source of many sicknesses.We live our comfortable lives in the shadow of a disaster of our own making. That disaster is being brought about by the very things that allow us to live our comfortable lives.Science had to have some mystery otherwise everyone would find out how simple it was.My faith in the expertise of physicists like Richard Feynman, for instance, permits me to endorse—and, if it comes to it, bet heavily on the truth of—a proposition that I don\\'t understand. So far, my faith is not unlike religious faith, but I am not in the slightest bit motivated to go to my death rather than recant the formulas of physics. Watch: E doesn\\'t equal mc2, it doesn\\'t, it doesn\\'t! I was lying, so there!The myth of quantum consciousness sits well with many whose egos have made it impossible for them to accept the insignificant place science perceives for humanity, as modern instruments probe the farthest reaches of space and time. ... quantum consciousness has about as much substance as the aether from which it is composed. Early in this century, quantum mechanics and Einstein’s relativity destroyed the notion of a holistic universe that had seemed within the realm of possibility in the century just past. First, Einstein did away with the aether, shattering the doctrine that we all move about inside a universal, cosmic fluid whose excitations connect us simultaneously to one another and to the rest of the universe. Second, Einstein and other physicists proved that matter and light were composed of particles, wiping away the notion of universal continuity. Atomic theory and quantum mechanics demonstrated that everything, even space and time, exists in discrete bits – quanta. To turn this around and say that twentieth century physics initiated some new holistic view of the universe is a complete misrepresentation of what actually took place. ... The myth of quantum consciousness should take its place along with gods, unicorns, and dragons as yet another product of the fantasies of people unwilling to accept what science, reason, and their own eyes tell them about the world.It is often said that there are very few places left on earth that have yet to be discovered. But those who say this are usually referring to places that exist at the human scale. Take a magnifying glass to any part of your house and you will find a whole new world to explore. Use a powerful microscope and you will find another, complete with a zoo of living organisms of the most fantastic nature. Alternatively, use a telescope and a whole universe of possibilities will open up before you.After long reflection in solitude and meditation, I suddenly had the idea, during the year 1923, that the discovery made by Einstein in 1905 should be generalised by extending it to all material particles and notably to electrons.The purpose of science is not down-scaling everything to physical level and measure, but to penetrate deeper into the realm beyond the sensory perceptions and bring more in-depth knowledge and wisdom to the world.It’s so hard to balance in our minds the knowledge that ‘the world’ is mundanely ‘a planet.’ The former is so holy; the latter merely a science project.Whenever we proceed from the known into the unknown we may hope to understand, but we may have to learn at the same time a new meaning of the word \\'understanding.I don\\'t think whole populations are villainous, but Americans are just extraordinarily unaware of all kinds of things. If you live in the middle of that vast continent, with apparently everything your heart could wish for just because you were born there, then why worry? [...] If people lose knowledge, sympathy and understanding of the natural world, they\\'re going to mistreat it and will not ask their politicians to care for it.Finally, from what we now know about the cosmos, to think that all this was created for just one species among the tens of millions of species who live on one planet circling one of a couple of hundred billion stars that are located in one galaxy among hundreds of billions of galaxies, all of which are in one universe among perhaps an infinite number of universes all nestled within a grand cosmic multiverse, is provincially insular and anthropocentrically blinkered. Which is more likely? That the universe was designed just for us, or that we see the universe as having been designed just for us?There is no indisputable proof for the big bang,\" said Hollus. \"And there is none for evolution. And yet you accept those. Why hold the question of whether there is a creator to a higher standard?Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to compute it.The most accessible field in science, from the point of view of language, is astrophysics. What do you call spots on the sun? Sunspots. Regions of space you fall into and you don’t come out of? Black holes. Big red stars? Red giants. So I take my fellow scientists to task. He’ll use his word, and if I understand it, I’ll say, “Oh, does that mean da-da-da-de-da?We\\'ve arranged a civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology. We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster.Night clubs are where Americans learn the laws of motion.It is the natural tendency of the ignorant to believe what is not true. In order to overcome that tendency it is not sufficient to exhibit the true; it is also necessary to expose and denounce the false. To admit that the false has any standing in court, that it ought to be handled gently because millions of morons cherish it and thousands of quacks make their livings propagating it—to admit this, as the more fatuous of the reconcilers of science and religion inevitably do, is to abandon a just cause to its enemies, cravenly and without excuse.Consider the Lichen. Lichens are just about the hardiest visible organisms on Earth, but the least ambitious.It is this mythical, or rather symbolic, content of the religious traditions which is likely to come into conflict with science. This occurs whenever this religious stock of ideas contains dogmatically fixed statements on subjects which belong in the domain of science.If biologists have ignored self-organization, it is not because self-ordering is not pervasive and profound. It is because we biologists have yet to understand how to think about systems governed simultaneously by two sources of order, Yet who seeing the snowflake, who seeing simple lipid molecules cast adrift in water forming themselves into cell-like hollow lipid vesicles, who seeing the potential for the crystallization of life in swarms of reacting molecules, who seeing the stunning order for free in networks linking tens upon tens of thousands of variables, can fail to entertain a central thought: if ever we are to attain a final theory in biology, we will surely, surely have to understand the commingling of self-organization and selection. We will have to see that we are the natural expressions of a deeper order. Ultimately, we will discover in our creation myth that we are expected after all.The tendency has always been strong to believe that whatever received a name must be an entity or being, having an independent existence of its own. And if no real entity answering to the name could be found, men did not for that reason suppose that none existed, but imagined that it was something peculiarly abstruse and mysterious.Modern life seems to recede further and further away from nature, and closely connected with this fact we seem to be losing the feeling of reverence towards nature. It is probably inevitable when science and machinery, capitalism and materialism go hand in hand so far in a most remarkably successful manner. Mysticism, which is the life of religion in whatever sense we understand it, has come to be relegated altogether in the background. Without a certain amount of mysticism there is no appreciation for the feeling of reverence, and, along with it, for the spiritual significance of humility. Science and scientific technique have done a great deal for humanity; but as far as our spiritual welfare is concerned we have not made any advances over that attained by our forefathers. In fact we are suffering at present the worst kind of unrest all over the world.One can ask why the I has to appear in the cogito {Descartes’ argument “I think therefore I am.}, since the cogito, if used rightly, is the awareness of pure consciousness, not directed at any fact or action. In fact the I is not necessary here, since it is never united directly to consciousness. One can even imagine a pure and self-aware consciousness which thinks of itself as impersonal spontaneity.Sigmund Freud was a novelist with a scientific background. He just didn’t know he was a novelist. All those damn psychiatrists after him, they didn’t know he was a novelist either.\"(Interview in Writers at Work: The Paris Review Interviews, Eighth Series, ed. George Plimpton, 1988)Knowledge is like an endless resource; a well of water that satisfies the innate thirst of the growing human soul. Therefore never stop learning... because the day you do, you will also stop maturing.Discover the force of the skies O Men: once recognised it can be put to use.Think outside the box? Indeed. But to add balance to that, one should not in the process forget what the inside of the box looks like as well. Those who are best at thinking outside the box do it not to puff themselves up, but to see how small they really are. As a contented fish in its fish tank appears to have a small, boring existence to us, imagine a larger, more perceptive kingdom (even by scientific taxonomy) to whom our contented existences may appear to be small and boring. This is where true creativity and massive perceptive abilities spawn a sense of intellectual humility; the kind which God adores.My mind was formed by studying philosophy, Plato and that sort of thing.when the words not enough to describe how much you love....even you know she/he don\\'t anything for you......you cant fall a sleep exactly like before\\'s\"-kuntalThe Apollo pictures of the whole Earth conveyed to multitudes something well known to astronomers: On the scale of the worlds - to say nothing of stars or galaxies - humans are inconsequential, a thin film of life on an obscure and solitary lump of rock and metalEvery conscious thought you have, every moment you spend on an idea, is a commitment to be stuck with that idea and with aspects of that level of thinking, for the rest of your life.

And then call me up on the homophone and read it to me.{Replying to G. H. Hardy\\'s suggestion that the number of a taxi (1729) was \\'dull\\', showing off his spontaneous mathematical genius}No, it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as a sum of two cubes in two different ways, the two ways being 13 + 123 and 93 + 103.The consequences of an act affect the probability of its occurring again.The industry had realized you could create the impression of controversy simply by asking questionsGravity always winsWhile the art of printing is left to us science can never be retrograde; what is once acquired of real knowledge can never be lost.Ever since the dawn of civilization, people have not been content to see events as unconnected and inexplicable. They have craved an understanding of the underlying order in the world. Today we still yearn to know why we are here and where we came from. Humanity\\'s deepest desire for knowledge is justification enough for our continuing quest. And our goal is nothing less than a complete description of the universe we live in.If a rat is a good model for your emotional life, you\\'re in big trouble.Aristotle maintained that women have fewer teeth than men; although he was twice married, it never occurred to him to verify this statement by examining his wives\\' mouths.When anyone tells me that he saw a dead man restored to life, I immediately consider with myself whether it be more probable that this person should either deceive or be deceived or that the fact which he relates should really have happened. I weigh the one miracle against the other and according to the superiority which I discover, I pronounce my decision. Always I reject the greater miracle. If the falsehood of his testimony would be more miraculous than the event which he relates, then and not till then, can he pretend to command my belief or opinion.A god who is capable of sending intelligible signals to millions of people simultaneously, and of receiving messages from all of them simultaneously, cannot be, whatever else he might be, simple. Such Bandwidth!Histories make men wise; poets, witty; the mathematics, subtle; natural philosophy, deep; moral, grave; logic and rhetoric, able to contend.One possibility is: God is nothing but the power of the universe to organize itself.Upon this first, and in one sense this sole, rule of reason, that in order to learn you must desire to learn, and in so desiring not be satisfied with what you already incline to think, there follows one corollary which itself deserves to be inscribed upon every wall of the city of philosophy: Do not block the way of inquiry.[Responding to the Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce\\'s question whether he traced his descent from an ape on his mother\\'s or his father\\'s side]A man has no reason to be ashamed of having an ape for his grandfather. If there were an ancestor whom I should feel shame in recalling it would rather be a man—a man of restless and versatile intellect—who … plunges into scientific questions with which he has no real acquaintance, only to obscure them by an aimless rhetoric, and distract the attention of his hearers from the real point at issue by eloquent digressions and skilled appeals to religious prejudice.The isolated man does not develop any intellectual power. It is necessary for him to be immersed in an environment of other men, whose techniques he absorbs during the first twenty years of his life. He may then perhaps do a little research of his own and make a very few discoveries which are passed on to other men. From this point of view the search for new techniques must be regarded as carried out by the human community as a whole, rather than by individuals.Understanding requires insight. Insight must be anchored.The value the world sets upon motives is often grossly unjust and inaccurate. Consider, for example, two of them: mere insatiable curiosity and the desire to do good. The latter is put high above the former, and yet it is the former that moves one of the most useful men the human race has yet produced: the scientific investigator. What actually urges him on is not some brummagem idea of Service, but a boundless, almost pathological thirst to penetrate the unknown, to uncover the secret, to find out what has not been found out before. His prototype is not the liberator releasing slaves, the good Samaritan lifting up the fallen, but a dog sniffing tremendously at an infinite series of rat-holes.Religions die when they are proved to be true. Science is the record of dead religions.Impossibility only lasts until you find new unbelievable hard evidences.So Yoda sounds like our best bet as an energy source. But with world electricity consumption pushing 2 terawatts, it would take a hundred million Yodas to meet our demands. All things considered, switching to Yoda power probably isn\\'t worth the trouble — though it would definitely be green.To err is human, to persist in error is diabolical.One reader of an early draft of this chapter complained at this point, saying that by treating the hypothesis of God as just one more scientific hypothesis, to be evaluated by the standards of science in particular and rational thought in general, Dawkins and I are ignoring the very widespread claim by believers in God that their faith is quite beyond reason, not a matter to which such mundane methods of testing applies. It is not just unsympathetic, he claimed, but strictly unwarranted for me simply to assume that the scientific method continues to apply with full force in this domain of truth.Very well, let\\'s consider the objection. I doubt that the defender of religion will find it attractive, once we explore it carefully.The philosopher Ronaldo de Souza once memorably described philosophical theology as \"intellectual tennis without a net,\" and I readily allow that I have indeed been assuming without comment or question up to now that the net of rational judgement was up. But we can lower it if you really want to.It\\'s your serve.Whatever you serve, suppose I return service rudely as follows: \"What you say implies that God is a ham sandwich wrapped in tin foil. That\\'s not much of a God to worship!\". If you then volley back, demanding to know how I can logically justify my claim that your serve has such a preposterous implication, I will reply: \"oh, do you want the net up for my returns, but not for your serves?Either way the net stays up, or it stays down. If the net is down there are no rules and anybody can say anything, a mug\\'s game if there ever was one. I have been giving you the benefit of the assumption that you would not waste your own time or mine by playing with the net down.Truth has nothing to do with the conclusion, and everything to do with the methodology.We may not yet know the right way to go, but we should at least stop going in the wrong direction.Es gibt keinen Gott und Dirac ist sein Prophet. (There is no God and Dirac is his Prophet.){A remark made during the Fifth Solvay International Conference (October 1927), after a discussion of the religious views of various physicists, at which all the participants laughed, including Dirac, as quoted in Teil und das Ganze (1969), by Werner Heisenberg, p. 119; it is an ironic play on the Muslim statement of faith, the Shahada, often translated: \\'There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is his Prophet.\\'}I do not consider myself a religious person, because I don\\'t adhere to a particular religion or faith or prescribed beliefs, as did my father, who was a Baptist minister. And I am not an atheist, one who thinks that belief in anything beyond the here and now and the rational is delusion. I love science, but I allow for mystery, things that can never be proven by a rational mind. I am a person who thinks about the nature of the spirit when I write. I think about what can\\'t be known and only imagined. I often sense a spirit or force or meaning beyond myself. I leave it open as to what the spirit is, but I continue to make guesses -- that it could be the universal binding of the emotion of love, or a joyful quality of humanity, or a collective unconscious that turns out to be a unified conscience. The spirit could be all those worshiped by all the religions, even those that deny the validity of others. It could be that we all exist in all ten dimensions of a string-theory universe and are seeding memories in all of them and occupy them simultaneously as memory. Or we exist only as thought and out perception that it is a physical world is a delusion. The nature of spirit could also be my mother and my grandmother and that they really do serve as my muses as I fondly imagine them doing at times. Or maybe the nature of the spirit is a freer imagination. I\\'ve often thought that imagination was the conduit to compassion, and compassion is a true spiritual nature. Whatever the spirit might be, I am not basing what I do in this life on any expected reward or punishment in the hereafter or thereafter. It is enough that I feel blessed -- and by whom or what I don\\'t know -- but I receive it with gratitude that I am a writer and my work is to imagine all the possibilities.In 1963, when I assigned the name \"quark\" to the fundamental constituents of the nucleon, I had the sound first, without the spelling, which could have been \"kwork.\" Then, in one of my occasional perusals of Finnegans Wake, by James Joyce, I came across the word \"quark\" in the phrase \"Three quarks for Muster Mark.\" Since \"quark\" (meaning, for one thing, the cry of a gull) was clearly intended to rhyme with \"Mark,\" as well as \"bark\" and other such words, I had to find an excuse to pronounce it as \"kwork.\" But the book represents the dreams of a publican named Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker. Words in the text are typically drawn from several sources at once, like the \"portmanteau words\" in Through the Looking Glass. From time to time, phrases occur in the book that are partially determined by calls for drinks at the bar. I argued, therefore, that perhaps one of the multiple sources of the cry \"Three quarks for Muster Mark\" might be \"Three quarts for Mister Mark,\" in which case the pronunciation \"kwork\" would not be totally unjustified. In any case, the number three fitted perfectly the way quarks occur in nature.Mr. Watson — Come here — I want to see you.[First intelligible words spoken over the telephone]Wind is renewable. Turbines are not.Not only are there meaningless questions, but many of the problems with which the human intellect has tortured itself turn out to be only \\'pseudo problems,\\' because they can be formulated only in terms of questions which are meaningless. Many of the traditional problems of philosophy, of religion, or of ethics, are of this character. Consider, for example, the problem of the freedom of the will. You maintain that you are free to take either the right- or the left-hand fork in the road. I defy you to set up a single objective criterion by which you can prove after you have made the turn that you might have made the other. The problem has no meaning in the sphere of objective activity; it only relates to my personal subjective feelings while making the decision.They (religions) dread the advance of science as witches do the approach of daylight and scowl on the fatal harbinger announcing the subversions of the duperies on which they live.Human tool-makers always make tools that will help us get what we want, and what we want hasn\\'t changed for thousands of years because as far as we can tell the human template hasn\\'t changed either. We still want the purse that will always be filled with gold, and the Fountain of Youth. We want the table that will cover itself with delicious food whenever we say the word, and that will be cleaned up afterwards by invisible servants. We want the Seven-League Boots so we can travel very quickly, and the Hat of Darkness so we can snoop on other people without being seen. We want the weapon that will never miss, and the castle that will keep us safe. We want excitement and adventure; we want routine and security. We want to have a large number of sexually attractive partners, and we also want those we love to love us in return, and be utterly faithful to us. We want cute, smart children who will treat us with the respect we deserve. We want to be surrounded by music, and by ravishing scents and attractive visual objects. We don\\'t want to be too hot or too cold. We want to dance. We want to speak with the animals. We want to be envied. We want to be immortal. We want to be gods.But in addition, we want wisdom and justice. We want hope. We want to be good.In our country religion is not different from philosophy and religion & philosophy don’t differ from science.I once read that if the folds in the cerebral cortex were smoothed out it would cover a card table. That seemed quite unbelievable but it did make me wonder just how big the cortex would be if you ironed it out. I thought it might just about cover a family-sized pizza: not bad, but no card-table. I was astonished to realize that nobody seems to know the answer. A quick search yielded the following estimates for the smoothed out dimensions of the cerebral cortex of the human brain.An article in Bioscience in November 1987 by Julie Ann Miller claimed the cortex was a \"quarter-metre square.\" That is napkin-sized, about ten inches by ten inches. Scientific American magazine in September 1992 upped the ante considerably with an estimated of 1 1/2 square metres; thats a square of brain forty inches on each side, getting close to the card-table estimate. A psychologist at the University of Toronto figured it would cover the floor of his living room (I haven\\'t seen his living room), but the prize winning estimate so far is from the British magazine New Scientist\\'s poster of the brain published in 1993 which claimed that the cerebral cortex, if flattened out, would cover a tennis court. How can there be such disagreement? How can so many experts not know how big the cortex is? I don\\'t know, but I\\'m on the hunt for an expert who will say the cortex, when fully spread out, will cover a football field. A Canadian football field.Many scientists have tried to make determinism and complementarity the basis of conclusions that seem to me weak and dangerous; for instance, they have used Heisenberg\\'s uncertainty principle to bolster up human free will, though his principle, which applies exclusively to the behavior of electrons and is the direct result of microphysical measurement techniques, has nothing to do with human freedom of choice. It is far safer and wiser that the physicist remain on the solid ground of theoretical physics itself and eschew the shifting sands of philosophic extrapolations.There are two kinds of truth: the truth that lights the way and the truth that warms the heart. The first of these is science, and the second is art. Neither is independent of the other or more important than the other. Without art science would be as useless as a pair of high forceps in the hands of a plumber. Without science art would become a crude mess of folklore and emotional quackery. The truth of art keeps science from becoming inhuman, and the truth of science keeps art from becoming ridiculous.\"(Great Thought, February 19, 1938)The only ethical principle which has made science possible is that the truth shall be told all the time. If we do not penalize false statements made in error, we open up the way for false statements by intention. And a false statement of fact, made deliberately, is the most serious crime a scientist can commit.I used to pray that God would feed the hungry, or do this or that, but now I pray that he will guide me to do whatever I\\'m supposed to do, what I can do. I used to pray for answers, but now I\\'m praying for strength. I used to believe that prayer changes things, but now I know that prayer changes us and we change things.One of the penalties of an ecological education is that one lives alone in a world of wounds.Be aware of this truth that the people on this earth could be joyous, if only they would live rationally and if they would contribute mutually to each others\\' welfare.This world is not a vale of sorrows if you will recognize discriminatingly what is truly excellent in it; and if you will avail yourself of it for mutual happiness and well-being. Therefore, let us explain as often as possible, and particularly at the departure of life, that we base our faith on firm foundations, on Truth for putting into action our ideas which do not depend on fables and ideas which Science has long ago proven to be false.Scientists, therefore, are responsible for their research, not only intellectually but also morally. This responsibility has become an important issue in many of today\\'s sciences, but especially so in physics, in which the results of quantum mechanics and relativity theory have opened up two very different paths for physicists to pursue. They may lead us - to put it in extreme terms - to the Buddha or to the Bomb, and it is up to each of us to decide which path to take. The point is that no matter what you choose to do with your body when you die, it won\\'t, ultimately, be very appealing. If you are inclined to donate yourself to science, you should not let images of dissection or dismemberment put you off. They are no more or less gruesome, in my opinion, than ordinary decay or the sewing shut of your jaws via your nostrils for a funeral viewing.If the world should blow itself up, the last audible voice would be that of an expert saying it can\\'t be done.Problems in science are sometimes made easier by adding complications.Keats mourned that the rainbow, which as a boy had been for him a magic thing, had lost its glory because the physicists had found it resulted merely from the refraction of the sunlight by the raindrops. Yet knowledge of its causation could not spoil the rainbow for me. I am sure that it is not given to man to be omniscient. There will always be something left to know, something to excite the imagination of the poet and those attuned to the great world in which they live (p. 64)Cutting off fundamental, curiosity-driven science is like eating the seed corn. We may have a little more to eat next winter but what will we plant so we and our children will have enough to get through the winters to come?It is either coincidence piled on top of coincidence,\" said Hollus, \"or it is deliberate design.Life is but a momentary glimpse of the wonder of this astounding universe, and it is sad to see so many dreaming it away on spiritual fantasy.And fragile is thy tenure of this worldStill haunted by the monstrous ghost of God.(\"To Science\")A kiss without a moustache, they said then, is like an egg without salt; I will add to it: and it is like Good without Evil.The scientific method is nothing more than a system of rules to keep us from lying to each other.In scientific thinking are always present elements of poetry. Science and music requires a thought homogeneous.One has a greater sense of intellectual degradation after an interview with a doctor than from any human experience.Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed. The imagination must be given not wings but weights.Mencari, itulah titah ilmu pada pengabdinya.God is the name we give to the science we don\\'t understand. Science is the name we give to the God we don\\'t understand.This seems charmingly paradoxical: scientists seek one truth but often voice many opinions; journalists often speak of many truths while voicing a uniform view.The true men of action in our time those who transform the world are not the politicians and statesmen but the scientists. Unfortunately poetry cannot celebrate them because their deeds are concerned with things, not persons, and are therefore speechless. When I find myself in the company of scientists, I feel like a shabby curate who has strayed by mistake into a drawing room full of dukes.Swords, Lances, arrows, machine guns, and even high explosives have had far less power over the fates of nations than the typhus louse, the plague flea, and the yellow-fever mosquito. Civilizations have retreated from the plasmodium of malaria, and armies have crumbled into rabbles under the onslaught of cholera spirilla, or of dysentery and typhoid bacilli. Huge areas have bee devastated by the trypanosome that travels on the wings of the tsetse fly, and generations have been harassed by the syphilis of a courtier. War and conquest and that herd existence which is an accompaniment of what we call civilization have merely set the stage for these more powerful agents of human tragedy.{Comment to Delambre on chemist Antoine Lavoisier\\'s execution during the French Revolution}Only a moment to cut off that head and a hundred years may not give us another like it.Man has made remarkable strides in conquering outer space, but how futile have been his efforts in conquering inner space- the space in our hearts and minds of men.Professor [John] Tyndall once said the finest inspiration he ever received was from an old man who could scarcely read. This man acted as his servant. Each morning the old man would knock on the door of the scientist and call, \\'Arise, Sir: it is near seven o\\'clock and you have great work to do today.La Ciencia en ningún momento está totalmente en lo cierto, pero rara vez está completamente equivocada y tiene en general mayores posibilidades de estar en lo cierto que las teorías no científicas.Science requires an engagement with the world, a live encounter between the knower and the known.Today everybody admits that something is wrong with the world, and the critics of Christianity are the very people who feel this most. The most violent attacks on religion come from those who are most anxious to change the world, and they attack Christianity because they think that it is an obstructive force that stands in the way of a real reform of human life. There has seldom been a time in which men were more dissatisfied with life and the more conscious of the need for deliverance, and if they turn away from Christianity it is because they feel that Christianity is a servant of the established order and that it has no real power or will to change the world and to rescue man from his present difficulties. They have lost their faith in the old spiritual traditions that inspired civilization in the past, and they tend to look for a solution in some external practical remedy such as communism, or the scientific organisation of life; something definite and objective that can be applied to society as a whole.I would teach how science works as much as I would teach what science knows. I would assert (given that essentially, everyone will learn to read) that science literacy is the most important kind of literacy they can take into the 21st century. I would undervalue grades based on knowing things and find ways to reward curiosity. In the end, it\\'s the people who are curious who change the world.Every science begins as philosophy and ends as art; it arises in hypothesis and flows into achievement.The study of mathematics is apt to commence in disappointment... We are told that by its aid the stars are weighed and the billions of molecules in a drop of water are counted. Yet, like the ghost of Hamlet\\'s father, this great science eludes the efforts of our mental weapons to grasp it.Science never solves a problem without creating ten moreIf your experiment needs a statistician, you need a better experiment.Try and penetrate with our limited means the secrets of nature and you will find that, behind all the descernible laws and connections, there remains something subtle, intangible and inexplicable. Veneration for this force beyond anything that we can comprehend is my religion. To that extent I am, in fact, religious.I had made up my mind to find that for which I was searching even if it required the remainder of my life. After innumerable failures I finally uncovered the principle for which I was searching, and I was astounded at its simplicity. I was still more astounded to discover the principle I had revealed not only beneficial in the construction of a mechanical hearing aid but it served as well as means of sending the sound of the voice over a wire. Another discovery which came out of my investigation was the fact that when a man gives his order to produce a definite result and stands by that order it seems to have the effect of giving him what might be termed a second sight which enables him to see right through ordinary problems. What this power is I cannot say; all I know is that it exists and it becomes available only when a man is in that state of mind in which he knows exactly what he wants and is fully determined not to quit until he finds it.A true conservationist is a man who knows that the world is not given by his fathers, but borrowed from his children.Life off Earth is in two important respects not at all unworldly: you can choose to focus on the surprises and pleasures, or the frustrations. And you can choose to appreciate the smallest scraps of experience, the everyday moments, or to value only the grandest, most stirring ones.The world keeps happening, in accordance with its rules; it\\'s up to us to make sense of it and give it value.Someone may have all the technical knowledge, scientific intellect and business know-how but when he/she decides to choose laziness, excuses, procrastination, complaining and other bad attitudes, his/her relevance is meaningless.Deviner avant de démontrer! Ai-je besoin de rappeler que c\\'est ainsi que se sont faites toutes les découvertes importantes.Guessing before proving! Need I remind you that it is so that all important discoveries have been made?The ideas of Freud were popularized by people who only imperfectly understood them, who were incapable of the great effort required to grasp them in their relationship to larger truths, and who therefore assigned to them a prominence out of all proportion to their true importance.All inquiries carry with them some element of risk.The scientific spirit is of more value than its products, and irrationally held truths may be more harmful than reasoned errors.I don\\'t know how many of you have ever met Dijkstra, but you probably know that arrogance in computer science is measured in nano-Dijkstras.Oh! to shoot for the stars if feels right. Aim for my heart if it feels right.Realizing the seriously ruthless, venomous habits and agendas of evil always instills a more fierce passion and longing for a closer God. Men, out of pride, may claim their own authorities over what constitutes good and evil; they may self-proclaim a keen knowledge of subjective morality through religion or science. But that is only if they are acknowledging the work of evil as a cartoon-like, petty little rain cloud in the sky that merely wants to dampen one\\'s spirits. On the contrary, a man could be without a doubt lit with the strength, the peace, and the knowledge of the gods, his gods, but when or if the devils grow weary in unsuccessful attempts to torment him, they begin tormenting his loved ones, or, if not his loved ones, anyone who may attempt to grasp his philosophies. No matter how godly he may become, God is, in the end, his only hope and his only grace for the pressures built around him - it is left up to a higher authority and a more solid peace and a wider love to eclipse not just one\\'s own evils but all evils for goodness to ultimately matter. If all men were gods, each being would dwell in a separate prison cell, hopeless, before finally imploding into nothingness.The successful development of science requires a proper balance to be maintained between the method of building up from observations and the method of deducing by pure reasoning from speculative assumptions.Science is a way of talking about the universe in words that bind it to a common reality.Magic is a method of talking to the universe in words that it cannot ignore.The two are rarely compatible.Electrons, when they were first discovered, behaved exactly like particles or bullets, very simply. Further research showed, from electron diffraction experiments for example, that they behaved like waves. As time went on there was a growing confusion about how these things really behaved ---- waves or particles, particles or waves? Everything looked like both.This growing confusion was resolved in 1925 or 1926 with the advent of the correct equations for quantum mechanics. Now we know how the electrons and light behave. But what can I call it? If I say they behave like particles I give the wrong impression; also if I say they behave like waves. They behave in their own inimitable way, which technically could be called a quantum mechanical way. They behave in a way that is like nothing that you have seen before. Your experience with things that you have seen before is incomplete. The behavior of things on a very tiny scale is simply different. An atom does not behave like a weight hanging on a spring and oscillating. Nor does it behave like a miniature representation of the solar system with little planets going around in orbits. Nor does it appear to be somewhat like a cloud or fog of some sort surrounding the nucleus. It behaves like nothing you have seen before.There is one simplication at least. Electrons behave in this respect in exactly the same way as photons; they are both screwy, but in exactly in the same way….The difficulty really is psychological and exists in the perpetual torment that results from your saying to yourself, \"But how can it be like that?\" which is a reflection of uncontrolled but utterly vain desire to see it in terms of something familiar. I will not describe it in terms of an analogy with something familiar; I will simply describe it. There was a time when the newspapers said that only twelve men understood the theory of relativity. I do not believe there ever was such a time. There might have been a time when only one man did, because he was the only guy who caught on, before he wrote his paper. But after people read the paper a lot of people understood the theory of relativity in some way or other, certainly more than twelve. On the other hand, I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics. So do not take the lecture too seriously, feeling that you really have to understand in terms of some model what I am going to describe, but just relax and enjoy it. I am going to tell you what nature behaves like. If you will simply admit that maybe she does behave like this, you will find her a delightful, entrancing thing. Do not keep saying to yourself, if you can possible avoid it, \"But how can it be like that?\" because you will get \\'down the drain\\', into a blind alley from which nobody has escaped. Nobody knows how it can be like that.If you don\\'t like the solution, change the problem.العلم دقيق أما الفن فصادق. انظر إلى لوحة لوجه إنسان أو منظر طبيعي... كم هما صادقان؟! إن فيهما من الصدق أكثر مما في أي صورة فوتوغرافية للوجة.But it seems to me to be an imperfection in things of beauty, and a weakness in man, if an explanation from the shallow-side has a destructive effect. The horror which we feel for Freudian interpretations is entirely due to our own barbaric or childish naivete, which believes that there can be heights without corresponding depths, and which blinds us to the really \"final\" truth that, when carried to extremes, opposites meet.The main objects of all science, the freedom and happiness of man. . . . [are] the sole objects of all legitimate government.(A plaque with this quotation, with the first phrase omitted, is in the stairwell of the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty.)Success is feeling good about the work you do throughout the long, unheralded journey that May or may not wind up at the launch pad. You can\\'t view training solely as a stepping stone to something loftier. It\\'s got to be an end in itself.دانشمندان علوم جديد در آن چه كه مربوط به حوزه ى تخصصى شان مى شود، عالمند ولى در آن چه مربوط به فرهنگ و تفكّر و آرمان هاى ممتاز بشريت مى شود افرادى متوسط و ميان مايه اند.Science itself, no matter whether it is the search for truth or merely the need to gain control over the external world, to alleviate suffering, or to prolong life, is ultimately a matter of feeling, or rather, of desire-the desire to know or the desire to realize.Sometimes when I\\'m having a boring interview on the telephone, and I\\'m trying to think about something else because the questions are too boring, and I start looking around the room where I work, you know, full of books piled up to the sky, all different kinds of topics. I start calculating how many centuries would I have to live reading twenty-four hours a day every day of the week to make a dent in what I\\'d like to learn about things, it\\'s pretty depressing.[...] You know, we have little bits of understanding, glimpses, a little bit of light here and there, but there\\'s a tremendous amount of darkness, which is a challenge. I think life would be pretty boring if we understood everything. It\\'s better if we don\\'t understand anything... and know that we don\\'t, that\\'s the important part.The stubborn critic would say: \\'What is the benefit of these sciences?\\' He does not know the virtue that distinguishes mankind from all the animals: it is knowledge, in general, which is pursued solely by man, and which is pursued for the sake of knowledge itself, because its acquisition is truly delightful, and is unlike the pleasures desirable from other pursuits. For the good cannot be brought forth, and evil cannot be avoided, except by knowledge. What benefit then is more vivid? What use is more abundant?We all have a thirst for wonder. It\\'s a deeply human quality. Science and religion are both bound up with it. What I\\'m saying is, you don\\'t have to make stories up, you don\\'t have to exaggerate. There\\'s wonder and awe enough in the real world. Nature\\'s a lot better at inventing wonders than we are.We have artists with no scientific knowledge and scientists with noartistic knowledge and both with no spiritual sense of gravity at all,and the result is not just bad, it is ghastly.The most telling and profound way of describing the evolution of the universe would undoubtedly be to trace the evolution of love.In the abstract, it might be tempting to imagine that irreducible complexity simply requires multiple simultaneous mutations - that evolution might be far chancier than we thought, but still possible. Such an appeal to brute luck can never be refuted... Luck is metaphysical speculation; scientific explanations invoke causes.How can cosmic religious feeling be communicated from one person to another, if it can give rise to no definite notion of a God and no theology? In my view, it is the most important function of art and science to awaken this feeling and keep it alive in those who are receptive to it.Science is the poetry of reality.\\u200eBy 2100, our destiny is to become like the gods we once worshipped and feared. But our tools will not be magic wands and potions but the science of computers, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and most of all, the quantum theory.Why do you like show jumping?\"\"...

And yet our conception of our surroundings remains the disproportionate view of the still-small child. We are spiritually and culturally paralyzed, unable to face the vastness, to embrace our lack of centrality and find our actual place in the fabric of nature. We batter this planet as if we had someplace else to go. That we even do science is a hopeful glimmer of mental health. However, it\\'s not enough merely to accept these insights intellectually while we cling to a spiritual ideology that is not only rootless in nature but also, in many ways, contemptuous of what is natural.Because you have seen something doesn\\'t mean you can explain it. Differing interpretations will always abound, even when good minds come to bear. The kernel of indisputable information is a dot in space; interpretations grow out of the desire to make this point a line, to give it direction. The directions in which it can be sent, the uses to which it can be put by a culturally, professionally, and geographically diverse society are almost without limit. The possibilities make good scientists chary.Language as putative science. - The significance of language for the evolution of culture lies in this, that mankind set up in language a separate world beside the other world, a place it took to be so firmly set that, standing upon it, it could lift the rest of the world off its hinges and make itself master of it. To the extent that man has for long ages believed in the concepts and names of things as in aeternae veritates he has appropriated to himself that pride by which he raised himself above the animal: he really thought that in language he possessed knowledge of the world. The sculptor of language was not so modest as to believe that he was only giving things designations, he conceived rather that with words he was expressing supreame knowledge of things; language is, in fact, the first stage of occupation with science. Here, too, it is the belief that the truth has been found out of which the mightiest sources of energy have flowed. A great deal later - only now - it dawns on men that in their belief in language they have propagated a tremendous error. Happily, it is too late for the evolution of reason, which depends on this belief, to be put back. - Logic too depends on presuppositions with which nothing in the real world corresponds, for example on the presupposition that there are identical things, that the same thing is identical at different points of time: but this science came into existence through the opposite belief (that such conditions do obtain in the real world). It is the same with mathematics, which would certainly not have come into existence if one had known from the beginning that there was in nature no exactly straight line, no real circle, no absolute magnitude.Something else gets under your skin, keeps you working days and nights at the sacrifice of your sleeping and eating and attention to your family and friends, something beyond the love of puzzle solving. And that other force is the anticipation of understanding something about the world that no one has ever understood before you.Einstein wrote that when he first realized that gravity was equivalent to acceleration -- an idea that would underlie his new theory of gravity -- it was the \"happiest thought of my life.\" On projects of far smaller weight, I have experienced that pleasure of discovering something new. It is an exquisite sensation, a feeling of power, a rush of the blood, a sense of living forever. To be the first vessel to hold this new thing.All of the scientists I\\'ve known have at least one more quality in common: they do what they do because they love it, and because they cannot imagine doing anything else. In a sense, this is the real reason a scientist does science. Because the scientist must. Such a compulsion is both blessing and burden. A blessing because the creative life, in any endeavor, is a gift filled with beauty and not given to everyone, a burden because the call is unrelenting and can drown out the rest of life.This mixed blessing and burden must be why the astrophysicist Chandrasekhar continued working until his mid-80\\'s, why a visitor to Einstein\\'s apartment in Bern found the young physicist rocking his infant with one hand while doing mathematical calculations with the other. This mixed blessing and burden must have been the \"sweet hell\" that Walt Whitman referred to when he realized at a young age that he was destined to be a poet. \"Never more,\" he wrote, \"shall I escape.I don\\'t believe that math and nature respond to democracy. Just because very clever people have rejected the role of the infinite, their collective opinions, however weighty, won\\'t persuade mother nature to alter her ways. Nature is never wrong....quantum mechanics—the physics of our world—requires that you hold such pedestrian complaints in abeyance.The sheer quantity of brain power that hurled itself voluntarily and quixotically into the search for new baseball knowledge was either exhilarating or depressing, depending on how you felt about baseball. The same intellectual resources might have cured the common cold, or put a man on Pluto.Science has made us gods even before we are worthy of being men.No Geologist worth anything is permanently bound to a desk or laboratory, but the charming notion that true science can only be based on unbiased observation of nature in the raw is mythology. Creative work, in geology and anywhere else, is interaction and synthesis: half-baked ideas from a bar room, rocks in the field, chains of thought from lonely walks, numbers squeezed from rocks in a laboratory, numbers from a calculator riveted to a desk, fancy equipment usually malfunctioning on expensive ships, cheap equipment in the human cranium, arguments before a road cut.Many people find bald, unvarnished truths so disturbing, they prefer to ram their heads in the sand and start dreaming at the first sign of scientific reality.No one can say if you are that person who, given good paint, good brushes, and a fine canvas, can produce something better than the factory man. That is, and has always been, beyond the realm of science. You do have the attitude of the dreamer about you. For that reason, I haven\\'t the heart to argue anymore about this - it is a hopeless talk. And for a simple factory man like me, an effort must be abandoned once its hopelessness is exposed. Only the artist perseveres in such circumstances.Is there any conflict between science and religion? There is no conflict in the mind of God, but often there is conflict in the minds of men.What is it, she asks me, why do people cry? Why do we cry when we\\'re happy and when we\\'re sad or hurt? I tell her what I know or think I know: that the body does not distinguish between emotional and physical pain; the muscles around the lachrymal glands receive a message from the brain, then tighten and squeeze out tears. Tears contain high levels of the hormone ACTH and prolactin, endorphins (which we know are mood-altering and pain-killing), as well as thirty times more manganese than is found in blood, suggesting that human tears can concentrate and remove harmful substances from the body. Prolactin in humans controls fluid balance; by the age of eighteen women have 60 percent more prolactin than men, which may explain why women seem to cry more often. I tell her that sadness--like happiness--is an intense feeling of being alive, of having essence. I try to explain to her my own nonscientific theory: that crying is about weight or heft, that we cry when our bodies feel too light or too heavy to bear or hold on to language.There, just beyond his open palm, was our mother’s face. I wasn’t expecting it. We hadn’t requested a viewing, and the memorial service was closed-coffin. We got it anyway. They’d shampooed and waved her hair and made up her face. They’d done a great job, but I felt taken, as if we’d asked for the basic carwash and they’d gone ahead and detailed her. Hey, I wanted to say, we didn’t order this. But of course I said nothing. Death makes us helplessly polite.One of the advantages of science is that one\\'s work, ultimately, is either replicated or it is not.It\\'s amazing to me that we humans have the intellectual capacity to ask deep questions and to devise methods for learning how the universe works and how its contents evolve with time.Half of all broccoli grown commercially in America today is a single variety- Marathon- notable for it\\'s high yield. The overwhelming majority of the chickens raised for meat in America are the same hybrid, the Cornish cross; more than 99 percent of turkeys are the Broad-Breasted Whites.It\\'s a bit like sympathetic magic in a way: the usual Western presumption that \\'primitive\\' rituals mimic what they desire to achieve--that phallic objects might be believed to increase male potency and playacting rainfall might somehow bring it about. I am suspicious of such obvious connections and I suspect that the connections among things, people, and processes can be equally irrational. I sense the world might be more dreamlike, metaphorical, and poetic than we currently believe--but just as irrational as sympathetic magic when looked at in a typically scientific way. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if poetry--poetry in the broadest sense, in the sense of a world filled with metaphor, rhyme, and recurring patterns, shapes, and designs--is how the world works. The world isn\\'t logical, it\\'s a song.Science isn\\'t just about blowing things up. Rather it\\'s about blowing things up and knowing how you did it.No fossil is buried with its birth certificate. That, and the scarcity of fossils, means that it is effectively impossible to link fossils into chains of cause and effect in any valid way... To take a line of fossils and claim that they represent a lineage is not a scientific hypothesis that can be tested, but an assertion that carries the same validity as a bedtime story—amusing, perhaps even instructive, but not scientific.We live in a world where unfortunately the distinction between true and false appears to become increasingly blurred by manipulation of facts, by exploitation of uncritical minds, and by the pollution of the language.Our true mentor in life is science.I\\'m comfortable with the unknown -- that\\'s the point of science. There are places out there, billions of places out there, that we know nothing about. And the fact that we know nothing about them excites me, and I want to go out and find out about them.And that\\'s what science is.So I think if you’re not comfortable with the unknown, then it’s difficult to be a scientist… I don’t need an answer. I don’t need answers to everything. I want to have answers to find.Until we have the courage to recognize cruelty for what it is... we cannot expect things to be much better in this world... We cannot have peace among men whose hearts delight in killing any living creature. By every act that glorifies or even tolerates such moronic delight in killing we set back the progress of humanity.Laboring through a world every day more stultified, which expected salvation in codes and governments, ever more willing to settle for suburban narratives and diminished payoffs--what were the chances of finding anyone else seeking to transcend that, and not even particularly aware of it?All over the world there are enormous numbers of smart, even gifted, people who harbor a passion for science. But that passion is unrequited. Surveys suggest that some 95 percent of Americans are “scientifically illiterate.Consistency is the playground of dull mindsIt is of great advantage to the student of any subject to read the original memoirs on that subject, for science is always most completely assimilated when it is in the nascent state...I was reading about animals a while back and there was this motherfucking scientist in France back in the thirties or forties or whenever the motherfuck it was and he was trying to get apes to draw these pictures, to make art pictures like the kinds of pictures in serious motherfucking paintings that you see in museums and shit. So the scientist keeps showing the apes these paintings and giving them charcoal pencils to draw with and then one day one of the apes finally draws something but it’s not the art pictures that it draws. What it draws is the bars of its own motherfucking cage. Its own motherfucking cage! Man, that\\'s the truth, ain\\'t it?May God us keepFrom Single vision and Newton\\'s sleep.Among all the occurrences possible in the universe the a priori probability of any particular one of them verges upon zero. Yet the universe exists; particular events must take place in it, the probability of which (before the event) was infinitesimal. At the present time we have no legitimate grounds for either asserting or denying that life got off to but a single start on earth, and that, as a consequence, before it appeared its chances of occurring were next to nil. ... Destiny is written concurrently with the event, not prior to it... The universe was not pregnant with life nor the biosphere with man. Our number came up in the Monte Carlo game. Is it surprising that, like the person who has just made a million at the casino, we should feel strange and a little unreal?All things remarkable are surprisingly simple; albeit difficult to find.Swiftly the brain becomes an enchanted loom, where millions of flashing shuttles weave a dissolving pattern-always a meaningful pattern-though never an abiding one.Is it possible that the Pentateuch could not have been written by uninspired men? that the assistance of God was necessary to produce these books? Is it possible that Galilei ascertained the mechanical principles of \\'Virtual Velocity,\\' the laws of falling bodies and of all motion; that Copernicus ascertained the true position of the earth and accounted for all celestial phenomena; that Kepler discovered his three laws—discoveries of such importance that the 8th of May, 1618, may be called the birth-day of modern science; that Newton gave to the world the Method of Fluxions, the Theory of Universal Gravitation, and the Decomposition of Light; that Euclid, Cavalieri, Descartes, and Leibniz, almost completed the science of mathematics; that all the discoveries in optics, hydrostatics, pneumatics and chemistry, the experiments, discoveries, and inventions of Galvani, Volta, Franklin and Morse, of Trevithick, Watt and Fulton and of all the pioneers of progress—that all this was accomplished by uninspired men, while the writer of the Pentateuch was directed and inspired by an infinite God? Is it possible that the codes of China, India, Egypt, Greece and Rome were made by man, and that the laws recorded in the Pentateuch were alone given by God? Is it possible that Æschylus and Shakespeare, Burns, and Beranger, Goethe and Schiller, and all the poets of the world, and all their wondrous tragedies and songs are but the work of men, while no intelligence except the infinite God could be the author of the Pentateuch? Is it possible that of all the books that crowd the libraries of the world, the books of science, fiction, history and song, that all save only one, have been produced by man? Is it possible that of all these, the bible only is the work of God?Then you get the wrong answer and you can\\'t go to the Moon that way! Nature isn\\'t a person, you can\\'t trick them into believing something else, if you try to tell the Moon it\\'s made of cheese you can argue for days and it won\\'t change the Moon! What you\\'re talking about is rationalization, like starting with a sheet of paper, moving straight down to the bottom line, using ink to write \\'and therefore, the Moon is made of cheese\\', and then moving back up to write all sorts of clever arguments above. But either the Moon is made of cheese or it isn\\'t. The moment you wrote the bottom line, it was already true or already false. Whether or not the whole sheet of paper ends up with the right conclusion or the wrong conclusion is fixed the instant you write down the bottom line.Where the frontier of science once was is now the centre.The apex of mathematical achievement occurs when two or more fields which were thought to be entirely unrelated turn out to be closely intertwined. Mathematicians have never decided whether they should feel excited or upset by such events.It was long before I could believe that human learning had no clear answer to this question. For a long time it seemed to me, as I listened to the gravity and seriousness wherewith Science affirmed its positions on matters unconnected with the problem of life, that I must have misunderstood something. For a long time I was timid in the presence in learning, and I fancied that the insufficiency of the answers which I received was not its fault, but was owing to my own gross ignorance, but this thing was not a joke or a pastime with me, but the business of my life, and I was at last forced, willy-nilly, to the conclusion that these questions of mine were the only legitimate questions underlying all knowledge, and that it was not I that was in fault in putting them, but science in pretending to have an answer for them.After the birth of printing books became widespread. Hence everyone throughout Europe devoted himself to the study of literature... Every year, especially since 1563, the number of writings published in every field is greater than all those produced in the past thousand years. The Paracelsians have created medicine anew and the Copernicans have created astronomy anew. I really believe that at last the world is alive, indeed seething, and that the stimuli of these remarkable conjunctions did not act in vain.People who live with OCD drag a metal sea anchor around. Obsession is a break, a source of drag, not a badge of creativity, a mark of genius or an inconvenient side effect of some greater function.The Earth is cylindrical, three times as wide as it is deep, and only the upper part is inhabited. But this Earth is isolated in space, and the sky is a complete sphere in the center of which is located, unsupported, our cylinder, the Earth, situated at an equal distance from all the points of the sky.But anyone who is practically acquainted with scientific work is aware that those who refuse to go beyond fact, rarely get as far as fact; and anyone who has studied the history of science knows that almost every great step therein has been made by the \\'anticipation of Nature,\\' that is, by the invention of hypotheses, which, though verifiable, often had very little foundation to start with.think of it.\\' said Robert Rosenbluth, a doctor whose acquaintance i made at the start of this book. \\'no engineer could design something as multifunctional and fine tuned as an anus. to call someone an asshole is really bragging him up.Every day, hundreds of observations and experiments pour into the hopper of the scientific literature. Many of them don\\'t have much to do with evolution - they\\'re observations about the details of physiology, biochemistry, development, and so on - but many of them do. And every fact that has something to do with evolution confirms its truth. Every fossil that we find, every DNA molecule that we sequence, every organ system that we dissect, supports the idea that species evolved from common ancestors. Despite innumerable possible observations that could prove evolution untrue, we don\\'t have a single one. We don\\'t find mammals in Precambrian rocks, humans in the same layers as dinosaurs, or any other fossils out of evolutionary order. DNA sequencing supports the evolutionary relationships of species originally deduced from the fossil record. And, as natural selection predicts, we find no species with adaptations that only benefit a different species. We do find dead genes and vestigial organs, incomprehensible under the idea of special creation. Despite a million chances to be wrong, evolution always comes up right. That is as close as we can get to a scientific truth.From the dawn of exact knowledge to the present day, observation, experiment, and speculation have gone hand in hand; and, whenever science has halted or strayed from the right path, it has been, either because its votaries have been content with mere unverified or unverifiable speculation (and this is the commonest case, because observation and experiment are hard work, while speculation is amusing); or it has been, because the accumulation of details of observation has for a time excluded speculation.Those distinct substances, which concretes generally either afford, or are made up of, may, without very much inconvenience, be called the elements or principles of them.It doesn\\'t matter how beautiful your theory is ... If it doesn\\'t agree with experiment, it\\'s wrong.For these two years I have been gravitating towards your doctrines, and since the publication of your primula paper with accelerated velocity. By about this time next year I expect to have shot past you, and to find you pitching into me for being more Darwinian than yourself. However, you have set me going, and must just take the consequences, for I warn you I will stop at no point so long as clear reasoning will take me further.{Letter of support to Charles Darwin on his theory of evolution}Quite often, when an idea that could be helpful presents itself, we do not appreciate it, for it is so inconspicuous. The expert has, perhaps, no more ideas than the inexperienced, but appreciates more what he has and uses it better.Western doctors are like poor plumbers. They treat a splashing tube by cleaning up the water. These plumbers are extremely apt at drying up the water, constantly inventing new, expensive, and refined methods of drying up water. Somebody should teach them how to close the tap.If we can\\'t think for ourselves, if we\\'re unwilling to question authority, then we\\'re just putty in the hands of those in power. But if the citizens are educated and form their own opinions, then those in power work for us. In every country, we should be teaching our children the scientific method and the reasons for a Bill of Rights. With it comes a certain decency, humility and community spirit. In the demon-haunted world that we inhabit by virtue of being human, this may be all that stands between us and the enveloping darkness.The four stages of acceptance:1. This is worthless nonsense.2. This is an interesting, but perverse, point of view.3. This is true, but quite unimportant.4. I always said so.\"(Review of The Truth About Death, in: Journal of Genetics 1963, Vol. 58, p.464)Science is the key to our future, and if you don’t believe in science, then you’re holding everybody back. And it’s fine if you as an adult want to run around pretending or claiming that you don’t believe in evolution, but if we educate a generation of people who don’t believe in science, that’s a recipe for disaster. We talk about the Internet. That comes from science. Weather forecasting. That comes from science. The main idea in all of biology is evolution. To not teach it to our young people is wrong.As a child, I was aware that, at night, infrared vision would reveal monsters hiding in the bedroom closet only if they were warm-blooded. But everybody knows that your average bedroom monster is reptilian and cold-blooded.At the very moment that humans discovered the scale of the universe and found that their most unconstrained fancies were in fact dwarfed by the true dimensions of even the Milky Way Galaxy, they took steps that ensured that their descendants would be unable to see the stars at all. For a million years humans had grown up with a personal daily knowledge of the vault of heaven. In the last few thousand years they began building and emigrating to the cities. In the last few decades, a major fraction of the human population has abandoned a rustic way of life. As technology developed and the cities were polluted, the nights became starless. New generations grew to maturity wholly ignorant of the sky that had transfixed their ancestors and that had stimulated the modern age of science and technology. Without even noticing, just as astronomy entered a golden age most people cut themselves off from the sky, a cosmic isolationism that ended only with the dawn of space exploration.Any faith that admires truth, that strives to know God, must be brave enough to accommodate the universe.But I try not to think with my gut. If I\\'m serious about understanding the world, thinking with anything besides my brain, as tempting as that might be, is likely to get me into trouble.I maintain that the cosmic religious feeling is the strongest and noblest motive for scientific research.I don\\'t think science is hard to teach because humans aren\\'t ready for it, or because it arose only through a fluke, or because, by and large, we don\\'t have the brainpower to grapple with it. Instead, the enormous zest for science that I see in first-graders and the lesson from the remnant hunter-gatherers both speak eloquently: A proclivity for science is embedded deeply within us, in all times, places, and cultures. It has been the means for our survival. It is our birthright. When, through indifference, inattention, incompetence, or fear of skepticism, we discourage children from science, we are disenfranchising them, taking from them the tools needed to manage their future.Certein bodies... become luminous when heated. Their luminosity disappears after some time, but the capacity of becoming luminous afresh through heat is restored to them by the action of a spark, and also by the action of radium.When I was little, I had this science book. There was a section on \\'What would happen to the world if there was no friction?\\' Answer: \\'Everything on earth would fly into space from the centrifugal force of revolution.\\' That was my mood.Whether in the intellectual pursuits of science or in the mystical pursuits of the spirit, the light beckons ahead, and the purpose surging in our nature responds.If the history-deniers who doubt the fact of evolution are ignorant of biology, those who think the world began less than ten thousand years ago are worse than ignorant, they are deluded to the point of perversity. They are denying not only the facts of biology but those of physics, geology, cosmology, archaeology, history and chemistry as well.Your Excellency, I have no need of this hypothesis.There are many hypotheses in science which are wrong. That’s perfectly all right: it’s the aperture to finding out what’s right. Science is a self-correcting process.No, it is not a commonplace, sir! If up to now, for example, I have been told to \\'love my neighbor,\\' and I did love him, what came of it?. . . What came of it was that I tore my caftan in two, shared it with my neighbor, and we were both left half naked, in accordance with the Russian proverb which says: If you chase several hares at once, you won\\'t overtake any one of them. But science says: Love yourself before all, because everything in the world is based on self-interest. If you love only yourself, you will set your affairs up properly, and your caftan will also remain in one piece. And economic truth adds that the more properly arranged personal affairs and, so to speak, whole caftans there are in society, the firmer its foundations are and the better arranged its common cause. It follows that by acquiring for everyone, as it were, and working so that my neighbor will have something more than a torn caftan, not from private, isolated generosities now, but as a result of universal prosperity.Anyone who thinks cryptozoology is the study of the impossible has never really taken a very good look at the so-called \"natural world.\" Once you get past the megamouth sharks, naked mole rats, and spotted hyenas, then the basilisks, dragons, and cuckoos just don\\'t seem that unreasonable. Unpleasant, yes, but unreasonable? Not really.Random mutations much more easily debilitate genes than improve them, and that this is true even of the helpful mutations. Let me emphasize, our experience with malaria’s effects on humans (arguably our most highly studied genetic system) shows that most helpful mutations degrade genes. What’s more, as a group the mutations are incoherent, meaning that they are not adding up to some new system. They are just small changes - mostly degradative - in pre-existing, unrelated genes. The take-home lesson is that this is certainly not the kind of process we would expect to build the astonishingly elegant machinery of the cell. If random mutation plus selective pressure substantially trashes the human genome, why should we think that it would be a constructive force in the long term? There is no reason to think so.The prediction I can make with the highest confidence is that the most amazing discoveries will be the ones we are not today wise enough to foresee.You spend months barely acknowledging someone\\'s existence and then BOOM, you\\'re emotionally addicted to her. Science would probably blame it on chemicals, genetics or something equally logical, but it didn\\'t feel like anything logicalThe History Of The Universe In Three WordsCHAPTER ONEBang!CHAPTER TWOsssssCHAPTER THREEcrunch.THE ENDThis is the team. We\\'re trying to go to the moon. If you can\\'t put someone up, please don\\'t put them down.You cannot separate passion from pathology any more than you can separate a person\\'s spirit from his body.Nothing is needed more than truth, and in relation to it everything else has only second-rate value.\"This unconditional will to truth—what is it? Is it the will not to allow oneself to be deceived? Or is it the will not to deceive? For the will to truth could be interpreted in the second way, too—if only the special case \"I do not want to deceive myself\" is subsumed under the generalization \"I do not want to deceive.\" But why not deceive?But why not allow oneself to be deceived?Note that the reasons for the former principle belong to an altogether different realm from those for the second. One does not want to allow oneself to be deceived because one assumes that it is harmful, dangerous, calamitous to be deceived. In this sense, science would be a long-range prudence, a caution, a utility; but one could object in all fairness: How is that? Is wanting not to allow oneself to be deceived really less harmful, less dangerous, less calamitous? What do you know in advance of the character of existence to be able to decide whether the greater advantage is on the side of the unconditionally mistrustful or of the unconditionally trusting?For the scientist, at exactly the moment of discovery—that most unstable existential moment—the external world, nature itself, deeply confirms his innermost fantastic convictions. Anchored abruptly in the world, Leviathan gasping on his hook, he is saved from extreme mental disorder by the most profound affirmation of the real.If the entire course of evolution were compressed into a single year, the earliest bacteria would appear at the end of March, but we wouldn\\'t see the first human ancestors until 6 a.m. on December 31st. The golden age of Greece, about 500 BCE, would occur just thirty seconds before midnight.What are the chances that we will one day discover that DNA has absolutely nothing to do with inheritance? They are effectively zero.Why would you take a drug that is guaranteed to kill you in forty years? One reason, right? It\\'s the only thing that will stop you dying tomorrow.Science is better than sympathy, if only it is science.The three-toed sloth lives a peaceful, vegetarian life in perfect harmony with its environment. A good-natured smile is forever on its lips...I have seen that smile with my own eyes. I am not one given to projecting human traits and emotions onto animals, but many a time during that month in Brazil, looking up at a sloth in repose, I felt I was in the presence of upside-down yogis deep in meditation or hermits deep in prayer, wise beings whose intense imaginative lives were beyond the reach of scientific probing.Le savant doit ordonner ; on fait la science avec des faits comme une maison avec des pierres ; mais une accumulation de faits n\\'est pas plus une science qu\\'un tas de pierres n\\'est une maison.The Scientist must set in order. Science is built up with facts, as a house is with stones. But a collection of facts is no more a science than a heap of stones is a house.We have not the reverent feeling for the rainbow that the savage has, because we know how it is made. We have lost as much as we gained by prying into that matter.Heroes and scholars represent the opposite extremes... The scholar struggles for the benefit of all humanity, sometimes to reduce physical effort, sometimes to reduce pain, and sometimes to postpone death, or at least render it more bearable. In contrast, the patriot sacrifices a rather substantial part of humanity for the sake of his own prestige. His statue is always erected on a pedestal of ruins and corpses... In contrast, all humanity crowns a scholar, love forms the pedestal of his statues, and his triumphs defy the desecration of time and the judgment of history.Human suffering has been caused because too many of us cannot grasp that words are only tools for our use.The mere presence in the dictionary of a word like \\'living\\' does not mean it necessarily has to refer to something definite in the real world.Magic is science. It’s simply a fancier term for showing people the impossible is attainable.Present global culture is a kind of arrogant newcomer. It arrives on the planetary stage following four and a half billion years of other acts, and after looking about for a few thousand years declares itself in possession of eternal truths. But in a world that is changing as fast as ours, this is a prescription for disaster. No nation, no religion, no economic system, no body of knowledge, is likely to have all the answers for our survival. There must be many social systems that would work far better than any now in existence. In the scientific tradition, our task is to find them.And yet we knew, for a certainty, that when first emissaries of Earth went walking among the planets, Earth\\'s other sons would be dreaming not about such expeditions but about a piece of bread.When you have only ever experienced privilege, equality feels like oppression.Am I right in suggesting that ordinary life is a mean between these extremes, that the noble man devotes his material wealth to lofty ends, the advancement of science, or art, or some such true ideal; and that the base man does the opposite by concentrating all his abilities on the amassing of wealth?\\'Exactly; that is the real distinction between the artist and the bourgeois, or, if you prefer it, between the gentleman and the cad. Money, and the things money can buy, have no value, for there is no question of creation, but only of exchange. Houses, lands, gold, jewels, even existing works of art, may be tossed about from one hand to another; they are so, constantly. But neither you nor I can write a sonnet; and what we have, our appreciation of art, we did not buy. We inherited the germ of it, and we developed it by the sweat of our brows. The possession of money helped us, but only by giving us time and opportunity and the means of travel. Anyhow, the principle is clear; one must sacrifice the lower to the higher, and, as the Greeks did with their oxen, one must fatten and bedeck the lower, so that it may be the worthier offering.The highest court is in the end one’s own conscience and conviction—that goes for you and for Einstein and every other physicist—and before any science there is first of all belief.It is a good principle in science not to believe any \\'fact\\'---however well attested---until it fits into some accepted frame of reference. Occasionally, of course, an observation can shatter the frame and force the construction of a new one, but that is extremely rare. Galileos and Einsteins seldom appear more than once per century, which is just as well for the equanimity of mankind.After the monkeys came down from the trees and learned to hurl sharp objects, they had had to move into caves for protection--not only from the big predatory cats but, as they began to lose their monkey fur, from the elements. Eventually, they started transposing their hunting fantasies onto cave walls in the form of pictures, first as an attempt at practical magic and later for the strange, unexpected pleasure they discovered in artistic creation. Time passed. Art came off the walls and turned into ritual. Ritual became religion. Religion spawned science. Science led to big business. And big business, if it continues on its present mindless, voracious trajectory, could land those of us lucky enough to survive its ultimate legacy back into caves again.The least I can do is speak out for the hundreds of chimpanzees who, right now, sit hunched, miserable and without hope, staring out with dead eyes from their metal prisons. They cannot speak for themselves.Bring forward what is true. Write it so that it is clear. Defend it to your last breath.Although nature commences with reason and ends in experience it is necessary for us to do the opposite, that is to commence with experience and from this to proceed to investigate the reason.The task of the modern era was the realization and humanization of God – the transformation and dissolution of theology into anthropology.Outside our consciousness there lies the cold and alien world of actual things. Between the two stretches the narrow borderland of the senses. No communication between the two worlds is possible excepting across the narrow strip. For a proper understanding of ourselves and of the world, it is of the highest importance that this borderland should be thoroughly explored.The larger a star the shorter its life, but all the more fascinating its death. As it collapses within it’s body, the infalling material can be no longer be compressed; the star is blown to pieces; its shattered mass realeases out ward at the speed of light.Sit down, have a nice cup of coffee read a book in another language - the fountain of youth!In space no one can hear you scream; and in a black hole, no one can see you disappear.In whatever disease sleep is laborious, it is a deadly symptom; but if sleep does good, it is not deadly.You may not think you eat a lot of corn and soybeans, but you do: 75 percent of the vegetable oils in your diet come from soy (representing 20 percent of your daily calories) and more than half of the sweeteners you consume come from corn (representing around 10 perecent of daily calories).Scientific People, unscientific mind; why are we dividing the world which could shine? Between religion and science, all what matters is human lives.Credentials are like potential energy, the compliments of a name on paper, in documents, word of mouth, but faith is like kinetic energy, the motion and the force that which is witnessed. Hence in the end it is the faith rather than the credentials that really takes you places.I happen to know this, and I happen to know that, and maybe I know that;and I work everything out from there. Tomorrow I may forgot that this is true, but remember that something else is true, so I can reconstruct it all again. I am never quite sure of where I am supposed to begin or where I am supposed to end. I just remember enough all the time so that as the memory fades and some of the pieces fall out I can put the thing back together again every dayGood problems and mushrooms of certain kinds have something in common; they grow in clusters.All science is a charted ignorance and belongs to Maya.If our sides were unequal our angles might be unequal. Instead of its being sufficient to feel, or estimate by sight, a single angle in order to determine the form of an individual, it would be necessary to ascertain each angle by the experiment of Feeling. But life would be too short for such a tedious groping. The whole science and art of Sight Recognition would at once perish; Feeling, so far as it is an art, would not long survive; intercourse would become perilous or impossible; there would be an end to all confidence, all forethought; no one would be safe in making the most simple social arrangements; in a word, civilization would relapse into barbarism.In fact a favourite problem of Tyndall is—Given the molecular forces in a mutton chop, deduce Hamlet or Faust therefrom. He is confident that the Physics of the Future will solve this easily.Eat healthy. Work hard. Stay strong. Worry less. Dance more. Love often. Be happy...I want to pause here and talk about this notion of consensus, and the rise of what has been called consensus science. I regard consensus science as an extremely pernicious development that ought to be stopped cold in its tracks. Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled. Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other, reach for your wallet, because you\\'re being had.Let\\'s be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus.There is no such thing as consensus science. If it\\'s consensus, it isn\\'t science. If it\\'s science, it isn\\'t consensus. Period.But you can’t be a scientist if you’re uncomfortable with ignorance, because scientists live at the boundary between what is known and unknown in the cosmos. This is very different from the way journalists portray us. So many articles begin, “Scientists now have to go back to the drawing board.One moment several things are possible, the next moment only one happens, and the rest don\\'t exist. Except that other worlds have sprung into being, on which the did happen.Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds. (quoting the Bhagavad-Gita after witnessing the first Nuclear explosion.)I would suggest that science is, at least in my part, informed worship.Glendower: I can call the spirits from the vasty deep.Hotspur: Why, so can I, or so can any man;But will they come, when you do call for them?To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I confess, absurd in the highest degree...The difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection , though insuperable by our imagination, should not be considered subversive of the theory.Science was many things, Nadia thought, including a weapon with which to hit other scientists.We get a lot of calls where the person is murdered at home, but is not found for a period of time. And so the animals have already started to take the body apart because they haven\\'t been fed in that period. So your evidence is being chewed up by the family pet.I tell you - Dogs are more loyal than cats. Cats will wait only a certain period of time and they\\'ll start chewing on you. Dogs will wait a day or two before they just can\\'t take the starving anymore. So, keep that in mind when choosing a pet. You know how a cat just stares at you, maybe at the top of the TV, from across the room? That\\'s because they\\'re watching to see if you\\'re gonna stop breathing.I tell you, the old-fashioned doctor who treated all diseases has completely disappeared, now there are only specialists, and they advertise all the time in the newspapers. If your nose hurts, they send you to Paris: there\\'s a European specialist there, he treats noses. You go to Paris, he examines your nose: I can treat only your right nostril, he says, I don\\'t treat left nostrils, it\\'s not my specialty, but after me, go to Vienna, there\\'s a separate specialist there who will finish treating your left nostril.Every day, and in every way, I am becoming better and better.I am not very impressed with theological arguments whatever they may be used to support. Such arguments have often been found unsatisfactory in the past. In the time of Galileo it was argued that the texts, \\'And the sun stood still... and hasted not to go down about a whole day\\' (Joshua x. 13) and \\'He laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not move at any time\\' (Psalm cv. 5) were an adequate refutation of the Copernican theory.I have not yet lost a feeling of wonder, and of delight, that this delicate motion should reside in all the things around us, revealing itself only to him who looks for it. I remember, in the winter of our first experiments, just seven years ago, looking on snow with new eyes. There the snow lay around my doorstep — great heaps of protons quietly precessing in the earth\\'s magnetic field. To see the world for a moment as something rich and strange is the private reward of many a discovery.My name is Ferrum. I was the first, born of the forges, when mankind first began to experiment with iron. I rose from their imagination, from their ambition to conquer the world with a metal that could slice through bronze like paper. I was there when the world started to shift, when humans took their first steps out of the Dark Ages into civilization. For many years, I thought I was alone. But mankind is never satisfied. Others came, risen from these dreams of a new world... Then, with the invention of computers, the gremlins came, and the bugs. Given life by the fear of monsters lurking in machines, these were more chaotic than the other fey, violent and destructive. They spread to every part of the world. As technology became a driving force in every country, powerful new fey rose into existence. Virus. Glitch. And Machina, the most powerful of all.Consider this: all the ants on the planet, taken together, have a biomass greater than that of humans. Ants have been incredibly industrious for millions of years. Yet their productiveness nourishes plants, animals, and soil. Human industry has been in full swing for little over a century, yet it has brought about a decline in almost every ecosystem on the planet. Nature doesn\\'t have a design problem. People do.The way we think may be completely different, but you and I are an ancient, archetypal couple, the original man and woman. We are the model for Adam and Eve. For all couples in love, there comes a moment when a man gazes at a woman with the very same kind of realization. It is an infinite helix, the dance of two souls resonating, like the twist of DNA, like the vast universe.The people who actually make the advances in theoretical physics don\\'t think in these categories that the philosophers and the historians of science subsequently invent for themMust be frustrating being a scientist. There you are, incrementally discovering how the universe works via a series of complex tests and experiments, for the benefit of all mankind - and what thanks do you get? People call you \"egghead\" or \"boffin\" or \"heretic\", and they cave your face in with a rock and bury you out in the wilderness. Not literally - not in this day and age - but you get the idea. Scientists are mistrusted by huge swathes of the general public, who see them as emotionless lab-coated meddlers-with-nature rather than, say, fellow human beings who\\'ve actually bothered getting off their arses to work this shit out. To a naturalist nothing is indifferent; the humble moss that creeps upon the stone is equally interesting as the lofty pine which so beautifully adorns the valley or the mountain: but to a naturalist who is reading in the face of the rocks the annals of a former world, the mossy covering which obstructs his view, and renders indistinguishable the different species of stone, is no less than a serious subject of regret.We preach and practice brotherhood — not only of man but of all living beings — not on Sundays only but on all the days of the week. We believe in the law of universal justice — that our present condition is the result of our past actions and that we are not subjected to the freaks of an irresponsible governor, who is prosecutor and judge at the same time; we depend for our salvation on our own acts and deeds and not on the sacrificial death of an attorney.Research is the process of going up alleys to see if they are blind.Everyone thinks that it was the big strong caveman who got the girl, and for the most part, that may have been true, but physical strength doesn\\'t explain how our species created civilization. I think there was always some scrawny dreamer sitting at the edge of the firelight, who had the ability to imagine dangers, to look into the future in his imagination and see possibilities, and therefore survived to pass his genes on to the next generation. When the big ape men ended up running off the cliff or getting killed while trying to beat a mastodon into submission with a stick, the dreamer was standing back thinking \\'Hey, that might work, but you need to run the mastodon off the cliff.\\' And, then he\\'d mate with the women left over after the go-getters got killed.The elegance of a mathematical theorem is directly proportional to the number of independent ideas one can see in the theorem and inversely proportional to the effort it takes to see them.The attitude which the man in the street unconsciously adopts towards science is capricious and varied. At one moment he scorns the scientist for a highbrow, at another anathematizes him for blasphemously undermining his religion; but at the mention of a name like Edison he falls into a coma of veneration. When he stops to think, he does recognize, however, that the whole atmosphere of the world in which he lives is tinged by science, as is shown most immediately and strikingly by our modern conveniences and material resources. A little deeper thinking shows him that the influence of science goes much farther and colors the entire mental outlook of modern civilised man on the world about him.A synthesis embracing both rational understanding and the mystical experience of unity is the mythos, spoken or unspoken, or our present day and age.This (...) had made me aware for the first time of the well-disguised myth that they and the academic institutions they represent are bastions of a free exchange of ideas. They are -but only of those ideas that don\\'t \\'rock the boat\\', that refrain from challenging hallowed taboos.…nature as a whole was an exceptionally fine illustration of science.The deepest of powers are often the most subtle. Something that most fail to realize... ☥The command of our language is crucial to focusing our thoughts and communicating them with precision to others.Reason is my prophet and it tells me that as a watch stops, so we die. It’s the end. If the watch doesn’t work properly, it must be fixed here and now by us.The time has come to realise that an interpretation of the universe—even a positivist one—remains unsatisfying unless it covers the interior as well as the exterior of things; mind as well as matter. The true physics is that which will, one day, achieve the inclusion of man in his wholeness in a coherent picture of the world.When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarely, in your thoughts advanced to the stage of science.The conclusion of intelligent design flows naturally from the data itself—not from sacred books or sectarian beliefs. Inferring that biochemical systems were designed by an intelligent agent is a humdrum process that requires no new principles of logic or science. It comes simply from the hard work that biochemistry has done over the past forty years, combined with consideration of the way in which we reach conclusions of design every day.The fundamental claim of intelligent design is straightforward and easily intelligible: namely, there are natural systems that cannot be adequately explained in terms of undirected natural forces and that exhibit features which in any other circumstance we would attribute to intelligence.You would hardly think, at first, that horrid monsters lie up there waiting to be discovered by any moderately penetrating mind--monsters to which those of the oceans bear no sort of comparison.\"What monsters may they be?\"Impersonal monsters, namely, Immensities. Until a person has thought out the stars and their inter-spaces, he has hardly learnt that there are things much more terrible than monsters of shape, namely, monsters of magnitude without known shape. Such monsters are the voids and waste places of the sky... In these our sight plunges quite beyond any twinkler we have yet visited. Those deep wells for the human mind to let itself down into, leave alone the human body! and think of the side caverns and secondary abysses to right and left as you pass on!...There is a size at which dignity begins,\" he exclaimed; \"further on there is a size at which grandeur begins; further on there is a size at which solemnity begins; further on, a size at which awfulness begins; further on, a size at which ghastliness begins. That size faintly approaches the size of the stellar universe. So am I not right in saying that those minds who exert their imaginative powers to bury themselves in the depths of that universe merely strain their faculties to gain a new horror?I am a member of a fragile species, still new to the earth, the youngest creatures of any scale, here only a few moments as evolutionary time is measured, a juvenile species, a child of a species. We are only tentatively set in place, error prone, at risk of fumbling, in real danger at the moment of leaving behind only a thin layer of of our fossils, radioactive at that.It goes with a courageous intent to greet the universe as it really is, not to foist our emotional predispositions on it but to courageously accept what our explorations tell us.I would not choose to live in any age but my own; advances in medicine alone, and the consequent survival of children with access to these benefits, should preclude any temptation to trade for the past. But we cannot understand history if we saddle the past with pejorative categories based on our bad habits for dividing continua into compartments of increasing worth towards the present. These errors apply to the vast paleontological history of life, as much as to the temporally trivial chronicle of human beings. I cringe every time I read that this failed business, or that defeated team, has become a dinosaur is succumbing to progress. Dinosaur should be a term of praise, not opprobrium. Dinosaurs reigned for more than 100 million years and died through no fault of their own; Homo sapiens is nowhere near a million years old, and has limited prospects, entirely self-imposed, for extended geological longevity. He did not know that the Old One was his father, for such a relationship was utterly beyond his understanding, but as he looked at the emaciated body he felt a dim disquiet that was the ancestor of sadness.Claims that cannot be tested, assertions immune to disproof are veridically worthless, whatever value the may have in inspiring us or in exciting our sense of wonder.Men are not potatoes!We were born of risen apes, not fallen angels, and the apes were armed killers besides. And so what shall we wonder at? Our murders and massacres and missiles, and our irreconcilable regiments?You must not lie about trilobites, nor yet about time....where were answers to the truly deep questions? Religion promised those, though always in vague terms, while retreating from one line in the sand to the next. Don\\'t look past this boundary, they told Galileo, then Hutton, Darwin, Von Neumann, and Crick, always retreating with great dignity before the latest scientific advance, then drawing the next holy perimeter at the shadowy rim of knowledge.As we parted at the Natural History Museum in London, I asked Richard Fortey how science ensures that when one person goes there\\'s someone ready to take his place.He chuckled rather heartily at my naiveté. \\'I\\'m afraid it\\'s not as if we have substitutes sitting on the bench somewhere waiting to be called in to play. When a specialist retires or, even more unfortunately, dies, that can bring a stop to things in that field, sometimes for a very long while.\\'And I suppose that\\'s why you value someone who spends forty-two years studying a single species of plant, even if it doesn\\'t produce anything terribly new?\\'\\'Precisely,\\' he said, \\'precisely.\\' And he really seemed to mean it.All objects in the universe are unique. No two things that happen by chance ever happen in exactly the same way. No two things are ever constructed or manufactured in exactly the same way. No two things wear in exactly the same way. No two things ever break in exactly the same way.The essential fact which emerges ... is that the three smallest and most active reservoirs ( of carbon in the global carbon cycle), the atmosphere, the plants and the soil, are all of roughly the same size. This means that large human disturbance of any one of these reservoirs will have large effects on all three. We cannot hope either to understand or to manage the carbon in the atmosphere unless we understand and manage the trees and the soil too.When the time is ripe for certain things, these things appear in different places in the manner of violets coming to light in early spring.Time and time again, throughout the history of medical practice, what was once considered as \"scientific\" eventually becomes regarded as \"bad practice\".Faith and science, I have learned, are two sides of the same coin, separated by an expanse so small, but wide enough that one side can\\'t see the other. They don\\'t even know they\\'re connected. Father and Lily were two sides of the same coin, I\\'ve decided, and maybe I am the space in between.There is much in this vision that will remind you of your mystics; yet between them and us there is far more difference than similarity, in respect both of the matter and the manner of our thought. For while they are confident that the cosmos is perfect, we are sure only that it is very beautiful. While they pass to their conclusion without the aid of intellect, we have used that staff every step of the way. Thus, even when in respect of conclusions we agree with your mystics rather than your plodding intellectuals, in respect of method we applaud most your intellectuals; for they scorned to deceive themselves with comfortable fantasies.Science ask facts and religion ask faith, humans are confused between life and death.I don\\'t mind nothing happening in a book, but nothing happening in a phony way--characters saying things people never say, doing jobs that don\\'t fit, the whole works--is simply asking too much of a reader. Something happening in a phony way must beat nothing happening in a phony way every time, right? I mean, you could prove that, mathematically, in an equation, and you can\\'t often apply science to literature.The atoms of the earth are formed inside of stars. Nothing really dies, everything is transformed.The surpluses will have to be expended somehow, and trust the oligarchs to find a way. Magnificent roads will be built. There will be great achievements in science, and especially in art. When the oligarchs have completely mastered the people, they will have time to spare for other things. They will become worshippers of beauty. They will become art-lovers. And under their direction and generously rewarded, will toil the artists. The result will be great art; for no longer, as up to yesterday, will the artists pander to the bourgeois taste of the middle class. It will be great art, I tell you, and wonder cities will arise that will make tawdry and cheap the cities of old time. And in these cities will the oligarchs dwell and worship beautyIt\\'s fun to think that one day our great, great grandchildren may get that much closer to understanding what the hell creation is doing here in the first place, and glimpsing the underlying structure and nature of matter itself. Hopefully they won\\'t live with the same existential horrors we all quietly face today in our own lives.\\xa0\\xa0There is a kind of bravery to our condition, I reckon: brought into being without an explanation, in a potentially infinite and apparently dead universe, and expected to just get on with it as though nothing strange is going on. Well it fucking is. And it\\'s all right to have a meltdown about the whole affair from time to time, faced with the pressures of modern existence, trying to be a good human and a good worker and a good son/daughter/parent, trying to be a good citizen, trying to be wise without condescension but uninhibited without recklessness, trying to just muddle through without making any silly decisions, trying to align with the correct political opinions, trying to stay thin, trying to be attractive, trying to be smart, trying to find the ideal partner, trying to stay financially secure, trying to just find some modest corner of meaning and belonging and sanity to go and sit in, and all the while living on the edge of dying forever.\\xa0\\xa0We\\'re all in the same strange boat, grappling with the same strange condition. But it isn\\'t quite so scary if we all do it together. So let\\'s do it together.Nobody knows what the whales may have to click and clack about, but it could be a form of voting-time to stop here and synchronously dive down in search of deep water squid, now time to resurface, move on, dive again. Clans also seem to caucus on which males they like and will mate with more or less as a group and which ones to collectively spurn. By all appearances, female sperm whales are terrible size queens. Over the generations, they have consistently voted in favor of enhanced male mass. Their dream candidate nowadays is some fellow named Moby, and he\\'s three times their size.Every time a scientist publishes a good piece of work, she helps to maintain and raise the standards for what is true. We have to keep chipping away.I can\\'t imagine the scientists wanting me to walk into the lab and start fiddling around with some big bowl of electrons they had out.If we reject science, we reject the common man.There is no greater power than the one others do not believe you possess.The aim of science is to make difficult things understandable in a simpler way; the aim of poetry is to state simple things in an incomprehensible way. The two are incompatible.What use was time to those who\\'d soon achieve Digital Immortality?It took less than an hour to make the atoms, a few hundred million years to make the stars and planets, but five billion years to make man!The smaller the creature, the bolder its spirit.Man has to awaken to wonder - and so perhaps do peoples. Science is a way of sending him to sleep again.Do you know where your breakthrough begins? Your breakthrough begins where your excuses ends.Read Euler, read Euler, he is the master of us all.Heroism doesn’t always happen in a burst of glory. Sometimes small triumphs and large hearts change the course of history. Sometimes a chicken can save a man’s life.If you removed all the arteries, veins, & capillaries from a person’s body, and tied them end-to-end…the person will die.Eratosthenes, the mapmaker who was the first man to accurately measure the size of the Earth, was a librarian.Of all the major religions, or lack thereof, the atheist\\'s is one of the best pretenders: his foundation for all existences, as well as moral behaviors for the permanent good of mankind, begins at science but ends at himself, the Napoleon complex of both intelligence and imagination. On the other hand the anti-theist wouldn\\'t survive without a deity beyond himself to hunt. He doesn\\'t pretend, he simply nullifies his own position.When we consider the magnitude and extent of his discoveries and their influence on the progress of science and of industry, there is no honour too great to pay to the memory of Faraday, one of the greatest scientific discoverers of all time.If music serves to convey feelings through the interaction of physical gestures and sound, the musician needs his brain state to match the emotional state he is trying to express. Although the studies haven\\'t been performed yet, I\\'m willing to bet that when B.B. King is playing the blues and when he is feeling the blues, the neural signatures are very similar. (Of course there will be differences, too, and part of the scientific hurdle will be subtracting out the processes involved in issuing motor commands and listening to music, versus just sitting on a chair, head in hands, and feeling down.) And as listeners, there is every reason to believe that some of our brain states will match those of the musicians we are listening to.Please understand something. God didn’t create evil in the world, but He did create free will, which allowed for the possibility of evil. Science isn’t like that. What you explore and find, God did create. It already exists. When you find it, you are discovering something God made. And everything God created is good. God said so in Genesis. He looked around at everything He had made and said, ‘It is very good.’There are two objectionable types of believers: those who believe the far-fetched, and those who believe that \\'belief\\' must be discarded and replaced by the \\'scientific method.\\' Between these two extremes there is enough scope for believing the reasonable and reasoning on sound beliefs.Facts do not fall in the face of discomfort.Vulnerable, like all men, to the temptations of arrogance, of which intellectual pride is the worst, he [the scientist] must nevertheless remain sincere and modest, if only because his studies constantly bring home to him that, compared with the gigantic aims of science, his own contribution, no matter how important, is only a drop in the ocean of truth.It’s possible that the reason I\\'ve never experienced a ghostly presence is that my temporal lobes aren\\'t wired for it. It could well be that the main difference between skeptics (Susan Blackmore notwithstanding) and believers is the neural structure they were born with. But the question still remains: Are these people whose EMF-influenced brains alert them to “presencesNot enough books focus on how a culture responds to radically new ideas or discovery. Especially in the biography genre, they tend to focus on all the sordid details in the life of the person who made the discovery. I find this path to be voyeuristic but not enlightening. Instead, I ask, After evolution was discovered, how did religion and society respond? After cities were electrified, how did daily life change? After the airplane could fly from one country to another, how did commerce or warfare change? After we walked on the Moon, how differently did we view Earth? My larger understanding of people, places and things derives primarily from stories surrounding questions such as those.Nature intended me for the tranquil pursuits of science, by rendering them my supreme delight. But the enormities of the times in which I have lived, have forced me to take a part in resisting them, and to commit myself on the boisterous ocean of political passions.The simplest strategy for bouts of noxious flatus is to not care. Or perhaps to take advantage of a gastroenterologist I know: get a dog. (To blame.)But, as Bacon has well pointed out, truth is more likely to come out of error, if this is clear and definite, than out of confusion, and my experience teaches me that it is better to hold a well-understood and intelligible opinion, even if it should turn out to be wrong, than to be content with a muddle-headed mixture of conflicting views, sometimes miscalled impartiality, and often no better than no opinion at all.Might it be possible at some future time, when neurophysiology has advanced substantially, to reconstruct the memories or insight of someone long dead?...It would be the ultimate breach of privacy.أنا غير كفؤ للحديث عن اللاشيء، لأن رجال الدين والفلاسفة هم خبراء في لاشيء!Because they are so long-lived, atoms really get around. Every atom you possess has almost certainly passed through several stars and been part of millions of organisms on its way to becoming you. We are each so atomically numerous and so vigorously recycled at death that a significant number of our atoms—up to a billion for each of us, it has been suggested—probably once belonged to Shakespeare. A billion more each came from Buddha and Genghis Khan and Beethoven, and any other historical figure you care to name. (The personages have to be historical, apparently, as it takes the atoms some decades to become thoroughly redistributed; however much you may wish it, you are not yet one with Elvis Presley.) So we are all reincarnations—though short-lived ones. When we die our atoms will disassemble and move off to find new uses elsewhere—as part of a leaf or other human being or drop of dew. Atoms, however, go on practically forever.If you stumble at mere believability, what are you living for? [...] Love is hard to believe, ask any lover. Life is hard to believe, ask any scientist.Speaking one day to Monsieur de Buffon, on the present ardor of chemical inquiry, he affected to consider chemistry but as cookery, and to place the toils of the laboratory on the footing with those of the kitchen. I think it, on the contrary, among the most useful of sciences, and big with future discoveries for the utility and safety of the human race.Science often progresses by carving out new distinctions that refine the fuzzy categories of natural language.Freedom, the first-born of science.A new consciousness is developing which sees the earth as a single organism and recognizes that an organism at war with itself is doomed. We are one planet. One of the great revelations of the age of space exploration is the image of the earth finite and lonely, somehow vulnerable, bearing the entire human species through the oceans of space and time.To make a deliberate falsification for personal gain is the last, worst depth to which either scholar or artist can descend in work or life.(Letter to Muriel St. Clare Byrne, 8 September 1935)I have been accused of a habit of changing my opinions. I am not myself in any degree ashamed of having changed my opinions. What physicist who was already active in 1900 would dream of boasting that his opinions had not changed during the last half century? In science men change their opinions when new knowledge becomes available; but philosophy in the minds of many is assimilated rather to theology than to science. The kind of philosophy that I value and have endeavoured to pursue is scientific, in the sense that there is some definite knowledge to be obtained and that new discoveries can make the admission of former error inevitable to any candid mind. For what I have said, whether early or late, I do not claim the kind of truth which theologians claim for their creeds. I claim only, at best, that the opinion expressed was a sensible one to hold at the time when it was expressed. I should be much surprised if subsequent research did not show that it needed to be modified. I hope, therefore, that whoever uses this dictionary will not suppose the remarks which it quotes to be intended as pontifical pronouncements, but only as the best I could do at the time towards the promotion of clear and accurate thinking. Clarity, above all, has been my aim.If we are merely matter intricately assembled, is this really demeaning? If there\\'s nothing here but atoms, does that make us less or does that make matter more?While the Copernican principle comes with no guarantees that it will forever guide us to cosmic truths, it\\'s worked quite well so far: not only is Earth not in the center of the solar system, but the solar system is not in the center of the Milky Way galaxy, the Milky Way galaxy is not in the center of the universe, and it may come to pass that our universe is just one of many that comprise a multiverse. And in case you\\'re one of those people who thinks that the edge may be a special place, we are not at the edge of anything either.Deux choses sont infinies : l’Univers et la bêtise humaine. Mais, en ce qui concerne l’Univers, je n’en ai pas encore acquis la certitude absolue.The neural processes underlying that which we call creativity have nothing to do with rationality. That is to say, if we look at how the brain generates creativity, we will see that it is not a rational process at all; creativity is not born out of reasoning.I\\'m frequently asked, \"Do you believe there\\'s extraterrestrial intelligence?\" I give the standard arguments- there are a lot of places out there, the molecules of life are everywhere, I use the word billions, and so on. Then I say it would be astonishing to me if there weren\\'t extraterrestrial intelligence, but of course there is as yet no compelling evidence for it.Often, I\\'m asked next, \"What do you really think?\"I say, \"I just told you what I really think.\"\"Yes, but what\\'s your gut feeling?\"But I try not to think with my gut. If I\\'m serious about understanding the world, thinking with anything besides my brain, as tempting as that might be, is likely to get me into trouble. Really, it\\'s okay to reserve judgment until the evidence is in.To put it bluntly but fairly, anyone today who doubts that the variety of life on this planet was produced by a process of evolution is simply ignorant—inexcusably ignorant, in a world where three out of four people have learned to read and write.Given her deafness, the auditory part of the brain, deprived of its usual input, had started to generate a spontaneous activity of its own, and this took the form of musical hallucinations, mostly musical memories from her earlier life. The brain needed to stay incessantly active, and if it was not getting its usual stimulation..., it would create its own stimulation in the form of hallucinations.Imagination is cheap as long as you don\\'t have to worry about the details.Even if not a single fossil has ever been found, the evidence from surviving animals would still overwhelmingly force the conclusion that Darwin was right.Wesley went everywhere with me from then on. I even wrapped him in baby blankets and held him in my arms while grocery shopping, to keep him warm during the first cold winter. Occasionally someone would ask to see \"the baby,\" and when I opened the blanket, would leap back shrieking, \"What is that?! A dinosaur?\" Apparently, the world is full of educated adults with mortgages and stock portfolios who think people are walking around grocery stores with dinosaurs in their arms.Although we credit God with designing man, it turns out He\\'s not sufficiently skilled to have done so. In point of fact, He unintentionally knocked over the first domino by creating a palette of atoms with different shapes. Electron clouds bonded, molecules bloomed, proteins embraced, and eventually cells formed and learned how to hang on to one another like lovebirds. He discovered that by simmering the Earth at the proper distance from the Sun, it instinctively sprouted with life. He\\'s not so much a creator as a molecule tinkerer who enjoyed a stroke of luck: He simply set the ball rolling by creating a smorgasbord of matter, and creation ensued.Moreover, knowledge and investigation help promote wonder they do not destroy it. Whatever our tastes, we can generally appreciate such things as music, art or wine better when we understand a bit about them. We read up on our favourite singers or artists because we feel we can appreciate their work better when we know how they think and what they bring to their work. The giddy delight and curiosity that comes from marvelling at the beauty of this universe is deepened, not cheapened, by the laws and facts science gives us to aid our understanding. In a similar way, the psychological tricks at work behind many seemingly paranormal events are truly more fascinating than the explanation of other-worldiness precisely because they are of this world, and say something about how rich and complex and mysterious we are as human beings to be convinced by such trickery, indeed to want to perpetuate it in the first place.People in science fiction flicks always seemed to know useful things about the places time travel took them. But what if the time traveler had been only an average history student? What then?Let us fool ourselves no longer. At the very moment Western nations, threw off the ancient regime of absolute government, operating under a once-divine king, they were restoring this same system in a far more effective form in their technology, reintroducing coercions of a military character no less strict in the organization of a factory than in that of the new drilled, uniformed, and regimented army. During the transitional stages of the last two centuries, the ultimate tendency of this system might b e in doubt, for in many areas there were strong democratic reactions; but with the knitting together of a scientific ideology, itself liberated from theological restrictions or humanistic purposes, authoritarian technics found an instrument at hand that h as now given it absolute command of physical energies of cosmic dimensions. The inventors of nuclear bombs, space rockets, and computers are the pyramid builders of our own age: psychologically inflated by a similar myth of unqualified power, boasting through their science of their increasing omnipotence, if not omniscience, moved by obsessions and compulsions no less irrational than those of earlier absolute systems: particularly the notion that the system itself must be expanded, at whatever eventual co st to life.Through mechanization, automation, cybernetic direction, this authoritarian technics has at last successfully overcome its most serious weakness: its original dependence upon resistant, sometimes actively disobedient servomechanisms, still human enough to harbor purposes that do not always coincide with those of the system.Like the earliest form of authoritarian technics, this new technology is marvellously dynamic and productive: its power in every form tends to increase without limits, in quantities that defy assimilation and defeat control, whether we are thinking of the output of scientific knowledge or of industrial assembly lines. To maximize energy, speed, or automation, without reference to the complex conditions that sustain organic life, have become ends in themselves. As with the earliest forms of authoritarian technics, the weight of effort, if one is to judge by national budgets, is toward absolute instruments of destruction, designed for absolutely irrational purposes whose chief by-product would be the mutilation or extermination of the human race. Even Ashurbanipal and Genghis Khan performed their gory operations under normal human limits.The center of authority in this new system is no longer a visible personality, an all-powerful king: even in totalitarian dictatorships the center now lies in the system itself, invisible but omnipresent: all its human components, even the technical and managerial elite, even the sacred priesthood of science, who alone have access to the secret knowledge by means of which total control is now swiftly being effected, are themselves trapped by the very perfection of the organization they have invented. Like the Pharoahs of the Pyramid Age, these servants of the system identify its goods with their own kind of well-being: as with the divine king, their praise of the system is an act of self-worship; and again like the king, they are in the grip of an irrational compulsion to extend their means of control and expand the scope of their authority. In this new systems-centered collective, this Pentagon of power, there is no visible presence who issues commands: unlike job\\'s God, the new deities cannot be confronted, still less defied. Under the pretext of saving labor, the ultimate end of this technics is to displace life, or rather, to transfer the attributes of life to the machine and the mechanical collective, allowing only so much of the organism to remain as may be controlled and manipulated.There\\'s nothing like the discovery of an unknown work by a great thinker to set the intellectual community atwitter and cause academics to dart about like those things one sees when looking at a drop of water under a microscope.There is no problem more difficult to solve than that created by ourselves.The slang for the rectum is \"prison wallet\".Give me the positions and velocities of all the particles in the universe, and I will predict the future.We can believe in the future and work to achieve it and preserve it, or we can whirl blindly on, behaving as if one day there will be no children to inherit our legacy. The choice is ours; the earth is in balance.Scientists need to invent a way to make DNA work like in cartoons.You are clever man, friend John; you reason well, and your wit is bold; but you are too prejudiced. You do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear, and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to you. Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand, and yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot? But there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men’s eyes, because they know – or think they know – some things which other men have told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to explain. But yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs, which think themselves new; and which are yet but the old, which pretend to be young – like the fine ladies at the opera....Today the invisible hand seems confused and indecisive...Ideology and rhetoric increasingly guide policy decision, often bearing little relationship to factual reality. And the America we once knew seems divided and angry, defiantly embracing unreason.Life is made up, not of great sacrifices or duties, but of little things, in which smiles and kindness, and small obligations given habitually, are what preserve the heart and secure the comfort.Can we be sure that they are incapable of the feelings or sentiments that are believed to place them on a lower scale than humans? Do we deny sensitivity to all of the so-called lower orders to blunt, protect, and, ultimately, deny our own? We will see that bees can grieve over teh loss of a queen, sound war cries or hum with contentment; they can be angry, docile, ferocious, playful, aggressive, appear happy, or utter pitiful sounds of distress. are these not emotions akin to ours, merely expressed differently?Si el universo fuese un vestido,¿cuál te pondrías esta noche?In essence what relativity says is that space and time are not absolute but relative both to the observer and the thing being observed, and the faster one moves the more pronounced these effects will become. We can never accelerate ourselves to the speed of light, and the harder we try(the faster we go) the more distorted we become, relative to an outside observer.Gravity disappears again, and we rise up off the floor like spooks from a grave. It\\'s like the Rapture in here every thirty seconds.Scientists are slowly waking up to an inconvenient truth - the universe looks suspiciously like a fix. The issue concerns the very laws of nature themselves. For 40 years, physicists and cosmologists have been quietly collecting examples of all too convenient \"coincidences\" and special features in the underlying laws of the universe that seem to be necessary in order for life, and hence conscious beings, to exist. Change any one of them and the consequences would be lethal. Fred Hoyle, the distinguished cosmologist, once said it was as if \"a super-intellect has monkeyed with physics\".To see the problem, imagine playing God with the cosmos. Before you is a designer machine that lets you tinker with the basics of physics. Twiddle this knob and you make all electrons a bit lighter, twiddle that one and you make gravity a bit stronger, and so on. It happens that you need to set thirtysomething knobs to fully describe the world about us. The crucial point is that some of those metaphorical knobs must be tuned very precisely, or the universe would be sterile.Example: neutrons are just a tad heavier than protons. If it were the other way around, atoms couldn\\'t exist, because all the protons in the universe would have decayed into neutrons shortly after the big bang. No protons, then no atomic nucleuses and no atoms. No atoms, no chemistry, no life. Like Baby Bear\\'s porridge in the story of Goldilocks, the universe seems to be just right for life.What a marvelous cooperative arrangement - plants and animals each inhaling each other\\'s exhalations, a kind of planet-wide mutual mouth-to-stoma resuscitation, the entire elegant cycle powered by a star 150 million kilometers away.Science is not a heartless pursuit of objective information; it is a creative human activity.Science is only a Latin word for knowledgeThose whose acquaintance with scientific research is derived chiefly from its practical results easily develop a completely false notion of the mentality of the men who, surrounded by a skeptical world, have shown the way to kindred spirits scattered wide through the world and through the centuries. Only one who has devoted his life to similar ends can have a vivid realization of what has inspired these men and given them the strength to remain true to their purpose in spite of countless failures. It is cosmic religious feeling that gives a man such strength. A contemporary has said, not unjustly, that in this materialistic age of ours the serious scientific workers are the only profoundly religious people.And life? Life itself? Was it perhaps only an infection, a sickening of matter? Was that which one might call the original procreation of matter only a disease, a growth produced by morbid stimulation of the immaterial? The first step toward evil, toward desire and death, was taken precisely then, when there took place that first increase in the density of the spiritual, that pathologically luxuriant morbid growth, produced by the irritant of some unknown infiltration; this, in part pleasurable, in part a motion of self-defense, was the primeval stage of matter, the transition from the insubstantial to the substance. This was the Fall.it is a federal system of sadistic torture, vivisection, and animal genocide, which has been carried on for decades under the fraudulent guise of respectable medical research. And nobody on the outside knows, or wants to know, or is willing to find out. My parents, my friends, my teachers, wouldnt listen to me, or suggested that if it was bothering me that much I just had to quit the job. Just like that. As if that would have solved anything. As if I could ever live with such cowardice. You can\\'t imagine, or maybe you can, how many people are convinced - without knowing the first thing about it - Animal research is essential. Americans have been hopelessly brainwashed on this issue. The animal rights people, by and large, acknowledge the essential futility of trying to change the system. So they address the smaller issues, fighting for legislation which would provide one extra visit per week to the labs by a custodian of the US dept of agriculture. Or demanding that a squirrel monkey be given an extra 12 square inches in his holding pen, before being led to the slaughter. That sort of thing. For whomever, and whatever it\\'s worth, I hope my little write up is clear. I dont have the guts to do whats necessary. I pray there\\'s someone out there who does. God help all of us.The advantage of the emotions is that they lead us astray, and the advantage of science is that it is not emotional.To be able to see into a friends\\' dream is a dream in itself.-Doctor Kōsaku Tokita (Paprika)Some information is classified legitimately; as with military hardware, secrecy sometimes really is in the national interest. Further, military, political, and intelligence communities tend to value secrecy for its own sake. It\\'s a way of silencing critics and evading responsibility - for incompetence or worse. It generates an elite, a band of brothers in whom the national confidence can be reliably vested, unlike the great mass of citizenry on whose behalf the information is presumably made secret in the first place. With a few exceptions, secrecy is deeply incompatible with democracy and with science.This fascination with computer models is something I understand very well. Richard Feynmann called it a disease. I fear he is right.(Ivan) Hold your tongue, or I\\'ll kill you!(The devil) You\\'ll kill me? No, excuse me, I will speak. I came to treat myself to that pleasure. Oh, I love the dreams of my ardent young friends, quivering with eagerness for life! \\'There are new men,\\' you decided last spring, when you were meaning to come here, \\'they propose to destroy everything and begin with cannibalism. Stupid fellows! they didn\\'t ask my advice! I maintain that nothing need be destroyed, that we only need to destroy the idea of God in man, that\\'s how we have to set to work. It\\'s that, that we must begin with. Oh, blind race of men who have no understanding! As soon as men have all of them denied God -- and I believe that period, analogous with geological periods, will come to pass -- the old conception of the universe will fall of itself without cannibalism, and, what\\'s more, the old morality, and everything will begin anew. Men will unite to take from life all it can give, but only for joy and happiness in the present world. Man will be lifted up with a spirit of divine Titanic pride and the man-god will appear. From hour to hour extending his conquest of nature infinitely by his will and his science, man will feel such lofty joy from hour to hour in doing it that it will make up for all his old dreams of the joys of heaven. Everyone will know that he is mortal and will accept death proudly and serenely like a god. His pride will teach him that it\\'s useless for him to repine at life\\'s being a moment, and he will love his brother without need of reward. Love will be sufficient only for a moment of life, but the very consciousness of its momentariness will intensify its fire, which now is dissipated in dreams of eternal love beyond the grave\\'... and so on and so on in the same style. Charming!Ivan sat with his eyes on the floor, and his hands pressed to his ears, but he began trembling all over. The voice continued.(The devil) The question now is, my young thinker reflected, is it possible that such a period will ever come? If it does, everything is determined and humanity is settled for ever. But as, owing to man\\'s inveterate stupidity, this cannot come about for at least a thousand years, everyone who recognises the truth even now may legitimately order his life as he pleases, on the new principles. In that sense, \\'all things are lawful\\' for him. What\\'s more, even if this period never comes to pass, since there is anyway no God and no immortality, the new man may well become the man-god, even if he is the only one in the whole world, and promoted to his new position, he may lightheartedly overstep all the barriers of the old morality of the old slaveman, if necessary. There is no law for God. Where God stands, the place is holy. Where I stand will be at once the foremost place... \\'all things are lawful\\' and that\\'s the end of it! That\\'s all very charming; but if you want to swindle why do you want a moral sanction for doing it? But that\\'s our modern Russian all over. He can\\'t bring himself to swindle without a moral sanction. He is so in love with truth-.Many textbooks point out that no animal has evolved wheels and cite the fact as an example of how evolution is often incapable of finding the optimal solution to an engineering problem. But it is not a good example at all. Even if nature could have evolved a moose on wheels, it surely would have opted not to. Wheels are good only in a world with roads and rails. They bog down in any terrain that is soft, slippery, steep, or uneven. Legs are better. Wheels have to roll along an unbroken supporting ridge, but legs can be placed on a series of separate footholds, an extreme example being a ladder. Legs can also be placed to minimize lurching and to step over obstacles. Even today, when it seems as if the world has become a parking lot, only about half of the earth\\'s land is accessible to vehicles with wheels or tracks, but most of the earth\\'s land is accessible to vehicles with feet: animals, the vehicles designed by natural selection.Is the conclusion that the universe was designed - and that the design extends deeply into life - science, philosophy, religion, or what? In a sense it hardly matters. By far the most important question is not what category we place it in, but whether a conclusion is true. A true philosophical or religious conclusion is no less true than a true scientific one. Although universities might divide their faculty and courses into academic categories, reality is not obliged to respect such boundaries.يا طير هجت الطائرينا ... و فتنت لب العالمينالله درك ساحرا ... أبطلت كيد الساحريناأظهرت معجزة العلوم... لنا و كنا كافريناإنا لقوم يعشقون... النابغين الباسلينايتسابقون حفاوة ... بالأقربين الأكرميناIt seems that scientific research reaches deeper and deeper. But it also seems that more and more people, at least scientists, are beginning to realize that the spiritual factor is important. I say \\'spiritual\\' without meaning any particular religion or faith, just simple warmhearted compassion, human affection, and gentleness. It is as if such warmhearted people are a bit more humble, a little bit more content. I consider spiritual values primary, and religion secondary. As I see it, the various religions strengthen these basic human qualities. As a practitioner of Buddhism, my practice of compassion and my practice of Buddhism are actually one and the same. But the practice of compassion does not require religious devotion or religious faith; it can be independent from the practice of religion. Therefore, the ultimate source of happiness for human society very much depends on the human spirit, on spiritual values. If we do not combine science and these basic human values, then scientific knowledge may sometimes create troubles, even disaster....I have come with this message: since our gods and our aspirations are no longer anything but scientific, why shouldn\\'t our loves be so too?Tugas peneliti adalah mengungkap rahasia dengan metodeFind a printer paper and imagine a full-grown bird shaped something like a football with legs standing on it. Imagine 33,000 of these rectangles in a grid. (Broilers are never in cages, and never on multiple levels.) Now enclose the grid with windowless walls and put a ceiling on top. Run in automated (drug-laced) feed, water, heating, and ventilation systems. This is a farm.Teaching students the evidence for and against Darwinism is not the same as teaching intelligent design. The U.S. Congress has officially endorsed teaching students \\'the full range of scientific views\\' about Darwinian evolution.All space is relative. There is no such thing as size. The telescope and the microscope have produced a deadly leveling of great and small, far and near. The only little thing is sin, the only great thing is fear!(\"The Jelly-Fish\")Genetics might be adequate for explaining microevolution, but microevolutionary changes in gene frequency were not seen as able to turn a reptile into a mammal or to convert a fish into an amphibian. Microevolution looks at adaptations that concern the survival of the fittest, not the arrival of the fittest... The origin of species — Darwin’s problem — remains unsolved.It\\'s almost as if each instant is our last and first. We are always dying, and always reborn. And that is living.I don\\'t need to travel back in time to cause trouble. Seeing back through time finds me trouble enough!...the ongoing suspicion that scientific discoveries or rigorous biblical scholarship will undermine faith is a tacit admission that faith is threatened by knowledge, because it is ultimately constructed on weak or faulty assumptions and, like the proverbial house of cards, needs to be \"protected\" from collapsing. (p. 21)It is true that neither the ancient wisdoms nor the modern sciences are complete in themselves. They do not stand alone. They call for one another. Wisdom without science is unable to penetrate the full sapiential meaning of the created and the material cosmos. Science without wisdom leaves man enslaved to a world of unrelated objects in which there is no way of discovering (or creating) order and deep significance in man\\'s own pointless existence. (p. 4)The idea that one can go to the fossil record and expect to empirically recover an ancestor-descendant sequence, be it of species, genera, families, or whatever, has been, and continues to be, a pernicious illusion.Regardless of one\\'s point of view, it\\'s quite easy to see that Darwinism is not in the same league as the hard sciences. For instance, Darwinists will often compare their theory favorably to Einsteinian physics, claiming that Darwinism is just as well established as general relativity. Yet how many physicists, while arguing for the truth of Einsteinian physics, will claim that general relativity is as well established as Darwin’s theory? Zero.He’s a scientist. He’s never cried. He flips through Googled image searches of burn victims while he touches himself.Together, \"Light and Knowledge\" are Inanimate, Intangible, and Inseparable.The most dangerous worldview is the worldview of those have not viewed the world.Not only were science and religion compatible, they were inseparable--the rise of science was achieved by deeply religious Christian scholars. It’s ever been the way of the man of science or philosophy. Most folks stay in the dark and then complain they can’t see nothing....evolution is not a religious tenet, to which one swears allegiance or belief as a matter of faith.. It is a factual reality of the empirical world. Just as one would not say \\'I believe in gravity,\" one should not proclaim \\'I believe in evolution.Although personally, I think cyberspace means the end of our species.Health is normal. The human body is a self-repairing, self-defending, self-healing marvel. Disease is relatively difficult to induce, considering the body\\'s powerful immune system. However, this complicated and delicate machinery can be damaged if fed the wrong fuel during the formative years. ... Healthy living with nutritional excellence throughout life can slow the decline of aging. It can prevent the years and years of suffering in ill health that is so common today as people get older and become dependent on medical treatments, drugs, and surgery. Nutritional excellence is the only real fountain of youth.One day, on tearing off some old bark, I saw two rare beetles, and seized one in each hand. Then I saw a third and new kind, which I could not bear to lose, so I popped the one which I held in my right hand into my mouth. Alas! it ejected some intensely acrid fluid, which burnt my tongue so that I was forced to spit the beetle out, which was lost, as was the third one.Because God is perfect, his handiwork functions in accord with immutable principles. By the full use of our God-given powers of reason and observation, it ought to be possible to discover these principles. These were the crucial ideas that explain why science arose in Christian Europe and no where else.IF YOU WANT TO CREATE A CHANGE, you must challenge not only the models of Unreality, but the paradigms that underwrite them.One could not be a successful scientist without realizing that , in contrast to the popular conception supported by newspapers and mothers of scientists, a goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid.Round about the accredited and orderly facts of every science there ever floats a sort of dust-cloud of exceptional observations, of occurrences minute and irregular and seldom met with, which it always proves more easy to ignore than to attend to... Anyone will renovate his science who will steadily look after the irregular phenomena, and when science is renewed, its new formulas often have more of the voice of the exceptions in them than of what were supposed to be the rules.The laboratory evidence that carbohydrate-rich diets can cause the body to reain water and so raise blood pressure, just as salt consumption is supposed to do, dates back well over a centuryYou\\'re going to see a lot of it.\\xa0People getting ahead unfairly\\xa0because of the category into which they were born: male or white or straight or rich. I\\'m in a few of those categories myself, which is why I make it a point to reach out and help those who aren\\'t, those who might not necessarily be seen if I didn\\'t make the effort. We need to shake this field up, you know? We need more people with different points of view and experiences and thought processes so we can keep innovating and moving ahead.He was a physicist, more precisely an astrophysicist, diligent and eager but without illusions: the Truth lay beyond, inaccessible to our telescopes, accessible to the initiates. This was a long road which he was traveling with effort, wonderment, and profound joy. Physics was prose: elegant gymnastics for the mind, mirror of Creation, the key to man\\'s dominion over the planet; but what is the stature of Creation, of man and the planet? His road was long and he had barely started up it, but I was his disciple: did I want to follow him?The best place to start the evolution of the vertebrates is the imagination.Each being in the universe yearns for the free energy necessary for survival and development. Each existence resists extinction. The consequent history of violence in the universe is as inevitable as the gravitational pull between the Earth and the Sun.... respecto al origen del mundo, si es que lo tuvo, no nos queda más remedio que aceptar que nunca sabremos cómo ocurrió y que Dios es una explicación necia que no explica nada pues es tan difícil imaginar la eternidad suya como la de la materia. Dios es la vuelta del bobo: lo postulamos para entender cuanto no entendemos, pero sin entenderlo a Él.At this point in history, our society tends to elevate and reward the specialist...This concentrated focus has brought some benefits...It may also be a modern malady. Specialization, when taken too far and allowed to define who and what we are, becomes limiting. It robs us of our wholeness and our self-sufficiency. It misses the big picture and confines us to a narrow zoom. And it leaves us at the mercy of experts.The three creative prototypes, the scientist, the artist, and the saint, know instinctively, without the help of any mere philosopher, that each must obey an absolute rule of conduct. Three words established and hallowed by usage express the divinities, the values, the supreme aims served respectively by these three kinds of men with an undivided loyalty: truth for the scientist; beauty for the artist; goodness for the saint. The discussion on what these words mean will never end. We must be content with taking note of their clarity as symbols, and of the singular force which animates them and makes of them powerful poles of attraction.I placed some of the DNA on the ends of my fingers and rubbed them together. The stuff was sticky. It began to dissolve on my skin. \\'It\\'s melting -- like cotton candy.\\' \\'Sure. That\\'s the sugar in the DNA,\\' Smith said. \\'Would it taste sweet?\\' \\'No. DNA is an acid, and it\\'s got salts in it. Actually, I\\'ve never tasted it.\\' Later, I got some dried calf DNA. I placed a bit of the fluff on my tongue. It melted into a gluey ooze that stuck to the roof of my mouth in a blob. The blob felt slippery on my tongue, and the taste of pure DNA appeared. It had a soft taste, unsweet, rather bland, with a touch of acid and a hint of salt. Perhaps like the earth\\'s primordial sea. It faded away.Page 67, in Richard Preston\\'s biographical essay on Craig Venter, \"The Genome Warrior\" (originally published in The New Yorker in 2000).Trust me Dani. You don’t want’a miss this. I’m not exaggeratin’ when I say the journey of a lifetime, of a hundred lifetimes, is just below us!Look too on this poor planet of ours,Torn by the storms of mysterious powers,Evil contending with good from its birth,Wrenching in battle the heartstrings of earth,—Ah! what infinities circle us here,Strangeness and wonderment swathing the sphere!In the new century science will defeat famine, boredom, and the plague, but . . . vital knowledge will become so elevated that nobody will know how anything works. . . . the good news is that everybody will be empowered; the bad news is nobody will understand why.Let us accept the possibility that there is, at death, not an abrupt cessation of energy, rather a dispersal. This seems more than reasonable to me. Mind you, I\\'ve owned a series of old cars, and I\"m used to turning off the motor only to experience a series of rumblings and explosions that would shame many a volcano. This is the sort of thing I\\'m conceptualizing, a kind of clunky running-on. And just as some cars are more susceptible to this behavior, so people vary in the length of time, and the force with which, their energy sputters and gasps. . . My example is overly dramatic, but it is not wholly unreasonable, and it serves to make this genetic mutation a player at the evolutionary table. You see what I\\'m getting at: a biologically and evolutionally sound model for the soul. (I didn\\'t say I\\'d achieved it.) Let\\'s conceive of the soul as an aura that human beings wear on their backs, cumberson as a tortoise\\'s carapace. Some are larger than others.The way to eliminate the harm caused by stereotypes is to teach our children to recognize false stereotypes, to be empathetic, and to be skeptical. We need to promote these critical-thinking skills in addition to instilling the best values we know. Skepticism, the heart of the scientific method, is the only way we know how to ferret out fact from fiction.Population genetics calculations suggest that in 5 million years (one million years longer than the alleged time between Ambulocetus and Rodhocetus), animals with generation lines of about ten years (typical of whales) could substitute no more than about 1,700 mutations.6 This is not nearly enough to generate the new information that whales need for aquatic life, even assuming that all the hypothetical information-adding mutations required for this could somehow arise. (And as shown in chapter 9, real science shows that this cannot occur.)As man gradually advanced in intellectual power, and was enabled to trace the more remote consequences of his actions; as he acquired sufficient knowledge to reject baneful customs and superstitions; as he regarded more and more, not only the welfare, but the happiness of his fellow-men; as from habit, following on beneficial experience, instruction and example, his sympathies became more tender and widely diffused, extending to men of all races, to the imbecile, maimed,and other useless members of society, and finally to the lower animals,—so would the standard of his morality rise higher and higher.If you can’t appreciate science and religion at the same time, your life must be scary.The cosmos is full beyond measure of elegant truths; of exquisite interrelationships; of the awesome machinery of nature. The surface of the Earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean. On this shore we\\'ve learned most of what we know. Recently we\\'ve waded a little way out, maybe ankle deep, and the water seems inviting. Some part of our being knows this is where we came from. We long to return. And we can. Because the cosmos is also within us. We\\'re made of star-stuff. We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.The sound of a thousand whispering ghosts surrounded her.Arguments from authority carry little weight – authorities have made mistakes in the past. They will do so again in the future. Perhaps a better way to say it is that in science there are no authorities; at most, there are experts.The traumatized person is often relieved simply to learn the true name of her condition. By ascertaining her diagnosis, she begins the process of mastery. No longer imprisoned in the wordlessness of the trauma, she discovers that there is a language for her experience. She discovers that she is not alone; others have suffered in similar ways. She discovers further that she is not crazy; the traumatic syndromes are normal human responses to extreme circumstances. And she discovers, finally, that she is not doomed to suffer this condition indefinitely; she can expect to recover, as others have recovered...The plural of anecdote is not data.But still try for who knows what is possible!Creating a better futureRequires creativity in the present.Now that science has helped us to overcome the awe of the unknown in nature, we are the slaves of social pressures of our own making. When called upon to act independently, we cry for patterns, systems, and authorities. If by enlightenment and intellectual progress we mean the freeing of man from superstitious belief in evil forces, in demons and fairies, in blind fate--in short, the emancipation from fear--then denunciation of what is currently called reason is the greatest service reason can render.Men-kind shared this world for but a blink, then, sadly, they became enlightened, found science and religion. The new world of men left little room for magic or the magical creatures of old. Earth’s first children were driven into the shadows by flame and cold iron, by man’s insatiable need of conquest.Thus, by science I mean, first of all, a worldview giving primacy to reason and observation and a methodology aimed at acquiring accurate knowledge of the natural and social world. This methodology is characterized, above all else, by the critical spirit: namely, the commitment to the incessant testing of assertions through observations and/or experiments — the more stringent the tests, the better — and to revising or discarding those theories that fail the test. One corollary of the critical spirit is fallibilism: namely, the understanding that all our empirical knowledge is tentative, incomplete and open to revision in the light of new evidence or cogent new arguments (though, of course, the most well-established aspects of scientific knowledge are unlikely to be discarded entirely).. . . I stress that my use of the term \\'science\\' is not limited to the natural sciences, but includes investigations aimed at acquiring accurate knowledge of factual matters relating to any aspect of the world by using rational empirical methods analogous to those employed in the natural sciences. (Please note the limitation to questions of fact. I intentionally exclude from my purview questions of ethics, aesthetics, ultimate purpose, and so forth.) Thus, \\'science\\' (as I use the term) is routinely practiced not only by physicists, chemists and biologists, but also by historians, detectives, plumbers and indeed all human beings in (some aspects of) our daily lives. (Of course, the fact that we all practice science from time to time does not mean that we all practice it equally well, or that we practice it equally well in all areas of our lives.)We all have an unscientific weakness for being always in the right, and this weakness seems to be particularly common among professional and amateur politicians. But the only way to apply something like scientific method in politics is to proceed on the assumption that there can be no political move which has no drawbacks, no undesirable consequences. To look out for these mistakes, to find them, to bring them into the open, to analyse them, and to learn from them, this is what a scientific politician as well as a political scientist must do. Scientific method in politics means that the great art of convincing ourselves that we have not made any mistakes, of ignoring them, of hiding them, and of blaming others from them, is replaced by the greater art of accepting the responsibility for them, of trying to learn from them, and of applying this knowledge so that we may avoid them in future.With the rise of classical Greece, the soul debate evolved into the more familiar heart-versus-brain, the liver having been demoted to an accessory role. We are fortunate that this is so, for we would otherwise have been faced with Celine Dion singing \"My Liver Belongs to You\" and movie houses playing The Liver Is a Lonely Hunter. Every Spanish love song that contains the word corazon, which is all of them, would contain the somewhat less lilting higado, and bumper stickers would proclaim, \"I [liver symbol] my Pekingese.[Religious belief is] outmoded and ridiculous. [Belief in gods was a] worn out but once useful crutch in mankind\\'s journey towards truth. We consider the time has come for that crutch to be abandoned.It is a vacuous answer... To say that \\'God made the world\\' is simply a more or less sophisticated way of saying that we don\\'t understand how the universe originated. A god, in so far as it is anything, is an admission of ignorance. Religion utterly failed to provide an explanation of the biosphere other than that \\'God made it all\\'. Then Darwin thundered over the horizon and in a few decades of observation and thought . . . arrived at an answer.I regard teaching religion as purveying lies. I came here today to de-corrupt you all.I am quite sure that our views on evolution would be very different had biologists studied genetics and natural selection before and not after most of them were convinced that evolution had occurred.It be urged that the wild and uncultivated tree, hitherto yielding sour and bitter fruit only, can never be made to yield better; yet we know that the grafting art implants a new tree on the savage stock, producing what is most estimable in kind and degree. Education, in like manner, engrafts a new man on the native stock, and improves what in his nature was vicious and perverse into qualities of virtue and social worth.Alfred Nobel stipulated that no distinction of race or colour will determine who received of his generosity.It tastes like water spiked with strange.Not that there\\'s anything wrong with just lying around on your back. In it\\'s way, rotting is interesting too, as we will see. It\\'s just that there are other ways to spend your time as a cadaver.The landed classes neglected technical education, taking refuge in classical studies; as late as 1930, for example, long after Ernest Rutherford at Cambridge had discovered the atomic nucleus and begun transmuting elements, the physics laboratory at Oxford had not been wired for electricity. Intellectual neglect technical education to this day.[Describing C.P. Snow\\'s observations on the neglect of technical education.]The real difficulty about volcanism is not to see how it can start, but how it can stop.I dislike this whole business of experimentation on animals, unless there\\'s some very good and altogether exceptional reason to this very case. The thing that gets me is that it\\'s not possible for the animals to understand why they are being called upon to suffer. They don\\'t suffer for their own good or benefit at all, and I often wonder how far it\\'s for anyone\\'s. They\\'re given no choice, and there is no central authority responsible for deciding whether what\\'s done is morally justifiable. These experiment animals are just sentient objects; they\\'re useful because they are able to react; sometimes precisely because they\\'re able to feel fear and pain. And they\\'re used as if they were electric light bulbs or boots. What it comes to is that whereas there used to be human and animal slaves, now there are just animal slaves. They have no legal rights or choices in the matter.Meteorites don’t fall on the Earth. They fall on the Sun and the Earth gets in the way.During World War II, when combat rations were tinned, meat hashes were a common entrée because they worked well with the filling machines. “But the men wanted something they could chew, something into which they could ‘sink their teeth,’The more I read arguments for atheism, the more I am convinced it takes a very strong faith to be an atheist. And atheism seems to me the least reasonable of all faiths.The works which this man leaves behind him occupy a few pages only; their importance is not greatly superior to their extent; and yet his name will shine out with lustre in the history of the sciences.{Cuvier on Joseph Banks}Justice, love, truth, peace and harmony, a serene unity with science and the laws of the universe.I [am] obliged to recur ultimately to my habitual anodyne, \"I feel: therefore I exist.\" I feel bodies which are not myself: there are other existencies then. I call them \"matter\". I feel them changing place. This gives me \"motion\". Where there is an absence of matter, I call it \"void\", or \"nothing\", or \"immaterial space\". On the basis of sensation, of matter and motion, we may erect the fabric of all the certainties we can have or need.Are we not witnessing a strange tableau of survival whenever a bird alights on the head of a crocodile, bringing together the evolutionary offspring of Triassic and Jurassic?Even in Europe a change has sensibly taken place in the mind of man. Science has liberated the ideas of those who read and reflect, and the American example has kindled feelings of right in the people.The attempt of Lavoisier to reform chemical nomenclature is premature. One single experiment may destroy the whole filiation of his terms; and his string of sulphates, sulphites, and sulphures, may have served no end than to have retarded the progress of science by a jargon, from the confusion of which time will be requisite to extricate us.You have heard of the new chemical nomenclature endeavored to be introduced by Lavoisier, Fourcroy, &c. Other chemists of this country, of equal note, reject it, and prove in my opinion that it is premature, insufficient and false. These latter are joined by the British chemists; and upon the whole, I think the new nomenclature will be rejected, after doing more harm than good. There are some good publications in it, which must be translated into the ordinary chemical language before they will be useful.It seems that all eukaryotic cells either have, or once had (and then lost) mitochondria. In other words, possession of mitochondria is a sine qua non of the eukaryotic conditionScience is what we have learned about how to keep from fooling ourselves.Science is the most reliable guide in life.The lifetime of a human being is measured by decades, the lifetime of the Sun is a hundred million times longer. Compared to a star, we are like mayflies, fleeting ephemeral creatures who live out their lives in the course of a single day.\\u200eUsing his burgeoning intelligence, this most successful of all mammals has exploited the environment to produce food for an ever increasing population. Instead of controlling the environment for the benefit of the population, perhaps it\\'s time we controlled the population to allow the survival of the environment.By denying scientific principles, one may maintain any paradox.There is no such things as magic, though there is such a thing as knowledge of the hidden ways of Nature.We have been led to imagine all sorts of things infinitely more marvelous than the imagining of poets and dreamers of the past. It shows that the imagination of nature is far, far greater than the imagination of man. For instance, how much more remarkable it is for us all to be stuck-half of us upside down-by a mysterious attraction, to a spinning ball that has been swinging in space for billions of years, than to be carried on the back of an elephant supported on a tortoise swimming in a bottomless sea.But the saddest difference between them was that Zazetsky, as Luria said, \\'fought to regain his lost faculties with the indomitable tenacity of the damned,\\' whereas Dr P. was not fighting, did not know what was lost. But who was more tragic, or who was more damned -- the man who knew it, or the man who did not?Without art, we should have no notion of the sacred; without science, we should always worship false gods.NASA spent millions of dollars inventing the ball-point pen so they could write in space. The Russians took a pencil.Think of the most fussy science teacher you ever had. The one who docked your grade if the sixth decimal place in your answer was rounded incorrectly; who tucked in his periodic table T-shirt, corrected every student who said \"weight\" when he or she meant \"mass\", and made everyone, including himself, wear goggles even while mixing sugar water. Now try to imagine someone whom your teacher would hate for being anal-retentive. That is the kind of person who works for a bureau of standards and measurement.[Doubt] is not a new idea; this is the idea of the age of reason. This is the philosophy that guided the men who made the democracy that we live under. The idea that no one really knew how to run a government led to the idea that we should arrange a system by which new ideas could be developed, tried out, and tossed out if necessary, with more new ideas bought in - a trial-and-error system. This method was a result of the fact that science was already showing itself to be a successful venture at the end of the eighteenth century. Even then it was clear to socially minded people that the openness of possibilities was an opportunity, and that doubt and discussion were essential to progress into the unknown. If we want to solve a problem that we have never solved before, we must leave the door to the unknown ajar...doubt is not to be feared, but welcomed and discussed.There are two kinds of truth; The truth that lights the way and the truth that warms the heart. The first of these is science and the second is art.If the universe does consist of a battle between the devil and God, the final analysis should conclude that religion would have been the devil’s most brilliant move and science, God’s.Metaphysics means nothing but an unusually obstinate effort to think clearly. The fundamental conceptions of psychology are practically very clear to us, but theoretically they are very confused, and one easily makes the obscurest assumptions in this science without realizing, until challenged, what internal difficulties they involve.My main reason for scepticism about the Huxley/Sagan theory is that the human brain is demonstrably eager to see faces in random patterns, as we know from scientific evidence, on top of the numerous legends about faces of Jesus, or the Virgin Mary, or Mother Teresa, being seen on slices of toast, or pizzas, or patches of damp on a wall. This eagerness is enhanced if the pattern departs from randomness in the specific direction of being symmetrical.Truths are as much a matter of questions as answers.When asked whether or not we are Marxists, our position is the same as that of a physicist, when asked if he is a “NewtonianAsking where memory is \"located\" in the brain is like asking where running is located in the body. There are certainly parts of the body that are more important (the legs) or less important (the little fingers) in performing the task of running but, in the end, it is an activity that requires complex coordination among a great many body parts and muscle groups. To extend the analogy, looking for differences between memory systems is like looking for differences between running and walking. There certainly are many differences, but the main difference is that running requires more coordination among the different body parts and can be disrupted by small things (such as a corn on the toe) that may not interfere with walking at all. Are we to conclude, then, that running is located in the corn on your toe?All what we think and know is an illusion. Nothing exists. Everything is an opinion.Why is it so difficult for us to think in relative terms? Well, for the good reason that human nature loves absoluteness, and erroneously considers it as a state of higher knowledge.In college, in the early 1950s, I began to learn a little about how science works, the secrets of its great success, how rigorous the standards of evidence must be if we are really to know something is true, how many false starts and dead ends have plagued human thinking, how our biases can colour our interpretation of evidence, and how often belief systems widely held and supported by the political, religious and academic hierarchies turn out to be not just slightly in error, but grotesquely wrong.That\\'s just how time travel looks like to the untrained eye. The reason why there aren\\'t more travelers is that your average physicist refuses to be eaten by a giraffe in the name of science.[Chemist Michael] Polanyi found one other necessary requirement for full initiation into science: Belief. If science has become the orthodoxy of the West, individuals are nevertheless still free to take it or leave it, in whole or in part; believers in astrology, Marxism and virgin birth abound. But \"no one can become a scientist unless he presumes that the scientific doctrine and method are fundamentally sound and that their ultimate premises can be unquestionably accepted.The best ship, the best culture, the best knowledge, is the one which allows us to go farther, explore more territories or oceans of reality, and have the least damaging leaks possible.إن الفن - بمعنى من المعاني - خارج من الزمان وخارج عن التاريخ. قد يكون له صعود وهبوط ، ولكن ليس له تطور ولا تاريخ بالمعنى العادي للمصطلح. ليس في الفن إحتواء للمعرفة أو الخبرة كما في العلم ، فمنذ العصر الحجري حتى اليوم ، لا ترى أي زيادة في القوة التعبيرية للفن تحققت عن طريق التطور.I was thinking of how sometimes, trying to say the right thing to people, it\\'s like some kind of brain surgery...Just as war is too important to leave it to the generals, science and technology are too important to leave in the hands of the experts.It\\'s true; life really is generous to those who pursue their Personal Legend.Any account of science which does not explicitly describe it as something we believe in is essentially incomplete and a false pretense. It amounts to a claim that science is essentially different from and superior to all human beliefs that are not scientific statements--and this is untrue.I remember one bobcat they had in here - now bobcats are an endangered species in this neck of the woods - they\\'d caught it somewhere and they must have put that cat through a dozen rounds of burn experiments before they finally determined that it was utterly useless to them. Like an empty beer can. And then you know what they did to it? Claudius was late for a lunch date so rather thanput the destroyed but still breathing animal to sleep, he picked it up by its hind legs and simply smashed its head against a wall repeatedly until it was dead. How can I forget it: I was the one told to clean up the mess. The head dented in. The eyes slowly closing. The once proud claws hanging down, stunned and lifeless, the utter senselessness of it all, and the hate, a hatred that was consummated in me which is as dangerous a hormone, or chemical, or portion of the brain, as any neutron bomb. Except that I didnt know how to explode. I was like a computer without a keyboard, a bird without wings. Roaring inside. I wanted to kill that man. To do unto others what they had done unto me. I was that bobcat, you better believe it.Science is an attempt, largely successful, to understand the world, to get a grip on things, to get hold of ourselves, to steer a safe course. Microbiology and meteorology now explain what only a few centuries ago was considered sufficient cause to burn women to death.Human beings, viewed as behaving systems, are quite simple. The apparent complexity of our behavior over time is largely a reflection of the complexity of the environment in which we find ourselves.Science is my territory, but science fiction is the landscape of my dreams.I would remind you to notice where the claim of consensus is invoked. Consensus is invoked only in situations where the science is not solid enough. Nobody says the consensus of scientists agrees that E=mc2. Nobody says the consensus is that the sun is 93 million miles away. It would never occur to anyone to speak that way.A scientist may not be sure of the answer, but he\\'s often sure he can find one. And that\\'s a condition which is clearly not enjoyed by philosophy.The humble Cumulus humilis - never hurt a soul.All creation necessarily ends in this: Creators, powerless, fleeing from the things they have wrought.Scientists seek the lawfulness of events. It is the task of Religion to fit man into this lawfulness.The most essential prediction of Darwinism is that, given an astronomical number of chances, unintelligent processes can make seemingly-designed systems, ones of the complexity of those found in the cell. ID specifically denies this, predicting that in the absence of intelligent input no such systems would develop. So Darwinism and ID make clear, opposite predictions of what we should find when we examine genetic results from a stupendous number of organisms that are under relentless pressure from natural selection. The recent genetic results are a stringent test. The results: 1) Darwinism’s prediction is falsified; 2) Design’s prediction is confirmed.If a conclusion is not poetically balanced, it cannot be scientifically true.Science is essentially an anarchic enterprise: theoretical anarchism is more humanitarian and more likely to encourage progress than its law-and-order alternatives.In the statistical gargon used in psychology, p refers to the probability that the difference you see between two groups (of introverts and extroverts, say, or males and females) could have occurred by chance. As a general rule, psychologists report a difference between two groups as \\'significant\\' if the probability that it could have occurred by chance is 1 in 20, or less. The possibility of getting significant results by chance is a problem in any area of research, but it\\'s particularly acute for sex differences research. Supppose, for example, you\\'re a neuroscientist interested in what parts of the brain are involved in mind reading. You get fifteen participants into a scanner and ask them to guess the emotion of people in photographs. Since you have both males and females in your group, you rin a quick check to ensure that the two groups\\' brains respond in the same way. They do. What do you do next? Most likely, you publish your results without mentioning gender at all in your report (except to note the number of male and female participants). What you don\\'t do is publish your findings with the title \"No Sex Differences in Neural Circuitry Involved in Understanding Others\\' Minds.\" This is perfectly reasonable. After all, you weren\\'t looking for gender difference and there were only small numbers of each sex in your study. But remember that even if males and females, overall, respond the same way on a task, five percent of studies investigating this question will throw up a \"significant\" difference between the sexes by chance. As Hines has explained, sex is \"easily assessed, routinely evaluated, and not always reported. Because it is more interesting to find a difference than to find no difference, the 19 failures to observe a difference between men and women go unreported, whereas the 1 in 20 finding of a difference is likely to be published.\" This contributes to the so-called file-drawer phenomenon, whereby studies that do find sex differences get published, but those that don\\'t languish unpublished and unseen in a researcher\\'s file drawer.There is much that science doesn\\'t understand, many mysteries still to be resolved. In a Universe tens of billions of light-years across and some ten or fifteen billion years old, this may be the case forever. We are constantly stumbling on new surprisesThe controversy between Darwinism and intelligent design has the characteristics of major scientific revolutions in the past. Darwinists are losing power because they treat with contempt the very people on whom they depend the most: American taxpayers. The outcome of this scientific revolution will be decided by young people who have the courage to question dogmatism and follow the evidence wherever it leads.Ewww... intelligent design people! They\\'re just buck-toothed, Bible-pushing nincompoops with community-college degrees who\\'re trying to sell a gussied-up creationism to a cretinous public! No need to address their concerns or respond to their arguments. They are Not Science. They are poopy-heads. There. I just saved you the trouble of reading 90 percent of the responses to the ID position... This is how losers act just before they lose: arrogant, self-satisfied, too important to be bothered with substantive refutation, and disdainful of their own faults... The only remaining question is whether Darwinism will exit gracefully, or whether it will go down biting, screaming, censoring, and denouncing to the bitter end.— Tech Central Station contributor Douglas Kern, 2005Ethics that focus on human interactions, morals that focus on humanity\\'s relationship to a Creator, fall short of these things we\\'ve learned. They fail to encompass the big take-home message, so far, of a century and a half of biology and ecology: life is- more than anything else- a process; it creates, and depends on, relationships among energy, land, water, air, time and various living things. It\\'s not just about human-to-human interaction; it\\'s not just about spiritual interaction. It\\'s about all interaction. We\\'re bound with the rest of life in a network, a network including not just all living things but the energy and nonliving matter that flows through the living, making and keeping all of us alive as we make it alive. We can keep debating ideologies and sending entreaties toward heaven. But unless we embrace the fuller reality we\\'re in- and reality\\'s implications- we\\'ll face big problems.I guess we\\'re all, or most of us, the wards of that nineteenth-century science which denied existence to anything it could not measure or explain. The things we couldn\\'t explain went right on but surely not with our blessing. We did not see what we couldn\\'t explain, and meanwhile a great part of the world was abandoned to children, insane people, fools, and mystics, who were more interested in what is than in why it is. So many old and lovely things are stored in the world\\'s attic, because we don\\'t want them around us and we don\\'t dare throw them out.No one disputes that seeming order can come out of the application of simple rules. But who wrote the rules?There\\'s no obvious reason to assume that the very same rare properties that allow for our existence would also provide the best overall setting to make discoveries about the world around us. We don\\'t think this is merely coincidental. It cries out for another explanation, an explanation that... points to purpose and intelligent design in the cosmos.Whenever explaining an event, we must choose from three competing modes of explanation. These are regularity, chance, and design... To attribute an event to design is to say that it cannot reasonably be referred to either regularity or chance.As long as scepticism is based on a sound understanding of science it is invaluable, for that is how science progresses. But poor criticism can lead those who are unfamiliar with the science involved into doubting everything about climate change predictions.If Darwinists are opposed to mentioning scientific problems with their view, you would think they would be even more opposed to mentioning intelligent design. Yet Darwinists have been discussing ID in public school science classes for years... Biology textbooks have been mentioning intelligent design since the late 1990s—but only to misrepresent and disparage it.In its quest to discover how the patterns of reality are organised, the story of modern science hints at a picture of a set of Chinese puzzle boxes, each one more intricately structured and wondrous than the last. Every time the final box appears to have been reached, a key has been found which has opened up another, revealing a new universe even more breathtakingly improbable in its conception. We are now forced to suspect that, for human reason, there is no last box, that in some deeply mysterious, virtually unfathomable, self-reflective way, every time we open a still smaller box, we are actually being brought closer to the box with which we started, the box which contains our own conscious experience of the world. This is why no theory of knowledge, no epistemology, can ever escape being consumed by its own self-generated paradoxes. And this is why we must consider the universe to be irredeemably mystical.I am serving the purpose for which I was designed, therefore I am satisfied with my existence.[...] if truth be told, evolution hasn’t yielded many practical or commercial benefits. Yes, bacteria evolve drug resistance, and yes, we must take countermeasures, but beyond that there is not much to say. Evolution cannot help us predict what new vaccines to manufacture because microbes evolve unpredictably. But hasn’t evolution helped guide animal and plant breeding? Not very much. Most improvement in crop plants and animals occurred long before we knew anything about evolution, and came about by people following the genetic principle of ‘like begets like’. Even now, as its practitioners admit, the field of quantitative genetics has been of little value in helping improve varieties. Future advances will almost certainly come from transgenics, which is not based on evolution at all.[review of The Evolving World: Evolution in Everyday Life, Nature 442, 983-984 (31 August 2006)]Cuba fikirkan, pelangi adalah penyebaran seluruh warna di dalam spektrum cahaya.

You look at the projected image. The drop is full of life - strange beings swimming, crawling, tumbling; high dramas of pursuit and escape, triumph and tragedy. This is a world populated by beings far more exotic than in any science fiction movie...The phrase \\'the fossil record\\' sounds impressive and authoritative. As used by some persons it becomes, as intended, intimidating, taking on the aura of esoteric truth as expounded by an elite class of specialists. But what is it, really, this fossil record? Only data in search of interpretation. All claims to the contrary that I know, and I know of several, are so much superstition.The human mind delights in finding pattern—so much so that we often mistake coincidence or forced analogy for profound meaning. No other habit of thought lies so deeply within the soul of a small creature trying to make sense of a complex world not constructed for it.The near side of a galaxy is tens of thousands of light-years closer to us than the far side; thus we see the front as it was tens of thousands of years before the back. But typical events in galactic dynamics occupy tens of millions of years, so the error in thinking of an image of a galaxy as frozen in one moment of time is small.No one, in the world\\'s whole history, ever attempted to substantiate a truth by a miracle. Truth scorns the assistance of miracle. Nothing but falsehood ever attested itself by signs and wonders. No miracle ever was performed, and no sane man ever thought he had performed one, and until one is performed, there can be no evidence of the existence of any power superior to, and independent of nature.The well-being of a neuron depends on its ability to communicate with other neurons. Studies have shown that electrical and chemical stimulation from both a neuron\\'s inputs and its targets support vital cellular processes. Neurons unable to connect effectively with other neurons atrophy. Useless, an abandoned neuron will die. There is no reason to assume that the universe has the slightest interest in intelligence—or even in life. Both may be random accidental by-products of its operations like the beautiful patterns on a butterfly\\'s wings. The insect would fly just as well without them.How can we find spiritual meaning in a scientific worldview? Spirituality is a way of being in the world, a sense of one’s place in the cosmos, a relationship to that which extends beyond oneself. . . . Does scientific explanation of the world diminish its spiritual beauty? I think not. Science and spirituality are complementary, not conflicting; additive, not detractive. Anything that generates a sense of awe may be a source of spirituality. Science does this in spades. (158-159)And if, by the end [of this book], you reckon you might still disagree with me, then I offer you this: you\\'ll still be wrong, but you\\'ll be wrong with a lot more panache and flair than you could possibly manage right now.If my nightmare is a culture inhabited by posthumans who regard their bodies as fashion accessories rather than the ground of being, my dream is a version of the posthuman that embraces the possibilities of information technologies without being seduced by fantasies of unlimited power and disembodied immortality, that recognizes and celebrates finitude as a condition of human being, and that understands human life is embedded in a material world of great complexity, one on which we depend for our continued survival.The aspirations of democracy are based on the notion of an informed citizenry, capable of making wise decisions. The choices we are asked to make become increasingly complex. They require the longer-term thinking and greater tolerance for ambiguity that science fosters. The new economy is predicated on a continuous pipeline of scientific and technological innovation. It can not exist without workers and consumers who are mathematically and scientifically literate. ...since the order of the world is shaped by death, mightn\\'t it be better for God if we refuse to believe in Him and struggle with all our might against death, without raising our eyes towards the heaven where He sits in silence?More profoundly, Nihilist \"simplification\" may be seen in the universal prestige today accorded the lowest order of knowledge, the scientific, as well as the simplistic ideas of men like Marx, Freud, and Darwin, which underlie virtually the whole of contemporary thought and life.We say \"life,\" for it is important to see that the Nihilist history of our century has not been something imposed from without or above, or at least has not been predominantly this; it has rather presupposed, and drawn its nourishment from, a Nihilist soil that has long been preparing in the hearts of the people. It is precisely from the Nihilism of the commonplace, from the everyday Nihilism revealed in the life and thought and aspiration of the people, that all the terrible events of our century have sprung. The world-view of Hitler is very instructive in this regard, for in him the most extreme and monstrous Nihilism rested upon the foundation of a quite unexceptional and even typical Realism. He shared the common faith in \"science,\" \"progress,\" and \"enlightenment\" (though not, of course, in \"democracy\"), together with a practical materialism that scorned all theology, metaphysics, and any thought or action concerned with any other world than the \"here and now,\" priding himself on the fact that he had \"the gift of reducing all problems to their simplest foundations.\" He had a crude worship of efficiency and utility that freely tolerated \"birth control\", laughed at the institution of marriage as a mere legalization of a sexual impulse that should be \"free\", welcomed sterilization of the unfit, despised \"unproductive elements\" such as monks, saw nothing in the cremation of the dead but a \"practical\" question and did not even hesitate to put the ashes, or the skin and fat, of the dead to \"productive use.\" He possessed the quasi-anarchist distrust of sacred and venerable institutions, in particular the Church with its \"superstitions\" and all its \"outmoded\" laws and ceremonies. He had a naive trust in the \"natural mom, the \"healthy animal\" who scorns the Christian virtues--virginity in particular--that impede the \"natural functioning\" of the body. He took a simple-minded delight in modern conveniences and machines, and especially in the automobile and the sense of speed and \"freedom\" it affords.There is very little of this crude Weltanschauung that is not shared, to some degree, by the multitudes today, especially among the young, who feel themselves \"enlightened\" and \"liberated,\" very little that is not typically \"modern.If we are seeking to serve the God of truth then we should really welcome truth from whatever source it comes. We shouldn’t fear the truth. Some of it will be from science, obviously, but by no means all of it. It will sometimes by perplexing, how this bit of truth relates to that bit of truth; we know that within science itself often enough and we find it outside of science as well. The crucial thing is to be honest.The important thing in science is not so much to obtain new facts as to discover new ways of thinking about themIf you thought you were trying to find out more about it because you\\'re gonna get an answer to some deep philosophical question...you may be wrong! It may be that you can\\'t get an answer to that particular question by finding out more about the character of nature. But my interest in science is to simply find out about the world.Science is an organized pursuit of triviality.Art is a casual pursuit of significance.Let\\'s keep it in perspective.The element of chance in basic research is overrated. Chance is a lady who smiles only upon those few who know how to make her smile.The history of science is the saga of nature defying common sense.All we know of the Missing Link is that he is missing - and he won\\'t be missed either.After all, that was a main purpose of science: to make things of all kinds happen sooner than they otherwise would.We will restore science to its rightful place and wield technology\\'s wonders to raise health care\\'s quality and lower its cost.Beneath the violet pillar, in the vacuum before the roar of the cloud, there came a soft sound that might have been heard by those who listened closely: the gentle sigh of an idea unbound.We are the lucky ones for we shall die, as there is an infinite number of possible forms of DNA all but a few billions of which will never burst into consciousness.It is my mood which decides the weather, it is my mood which brings the tiny changes to humankind.The Creator has – I say it in all reverence - drawn a myriad red herrings across the track, but the true scientist refuses to be baffled by superficial appearances in detecting the secrets of Nature. The vulgar herd catches at the gross apparent fact, but the man of insight knows what lies on the surfaces does lie.For those scientists who take it seriously, Darwinian evolution has functioned more as a philosophical belief system than as a testable scientific hypothesis. This quasi-religious function of the theory is, I think, what lies behind many of the extreme statements that you have doubtless encountered from some scientists opposing any critical analysis of neo-Darwinism in the classroom. It is also why many scientists make public statements about the theory that they would not defend privately to other scientists like me.Ask a true scientist a very profound question on his science, and he will besilent. Ask a true religious person a very simple question on his religion, and he will be frenzied.Science is not a collection of facts. Nor is science something that happens in the laboratory. Science happens in the head. It\\'s a flight of imagination beyond the constraints of ordinary perception. Columbus chapter -The Virgin and the MousetrapAnd before you say this is all far-fetched, just think how far the human race has come in the past ten years. If someone had told your parents, for example, that they would be able to carry their entire music library in their pocket, would they have believed it? Now we have phones that have more computing power than was used to send some of the first rockets into space. We have electron microscopes that can see individual atoms. We routinely cure diseases that only fifty years ago was fatal. and the rate of change is increasing. Today we are able to do what your parents would of dismissed as impossible and your grandparents nothing short of magical....but I still think that to the unprejudiced, the fossil record of plants is in favor of special creation.The ideology and philosophy of neo-Darwinism which is sold by its adepts as a scientific theoretical foundation of biology seriously hampers the development of science and hides from students the field’s real problems.By far the greatest danger of Artificial Intelligence is that people conclude too early that they understand it.We are constantly being shaped by seemingly irrelevant stimuli, subliminal information, and internal forces we don\\'t know a thing about.When you are famous it is hard to work on small problems. This is what did Shannon in. After information theory, what do you do for an encore? The great scientists often make this error. They fail to continue to plant the little acorns from which the mighty oak trees grow. They try to get the big thing right off. And that isn\\'t the way things go. So that is another reason why you find that when you get early recognition it seems to sterilize you.Some piously record \\'In the beginning God\\', but I say \\'In the beginning hydrogen\\'.But let us not forget that human love and compassion are equally deeply rooted in our primate heritage, and in this sphere too our sensibilities are of a higher order of magnitude than those of chimpanzees.Mathematical Knowledge adds a manly Vigour to the Mind, frees it from Prejudice, Credulity, and Superstition.It’s hard to build models of inflation that don\\'t lead to a multiverse. It’s not impossible, so I think there’s still certainly research that needs to be done. But most models of inflation do lead to a multiverse, and evidence for inflation will be pushing us in the direction of taking [the idea of a] multiverse seriously.People say we are playing God. My answer is: If we don\\'t play God, who will?Science demands from a man all his life. If you had two lives that would not be enough for you. Be passionate in your work and in your searching.The steam engine has done much more for science than science has done for the steam engine.Through the discovery of Buchner, Biology was relieved of another fragment of mysticism. The splitting up of sugar into CO2 and alcohol is no more the effect of a \\'vital principle\\' than the splitting up of cane sugar by invertase. The history of this problem is instructive, as it warns us against considering problems as beyond our reach because they have not yet found their solution.Our novice runs the risk of failure without additional traits: a strong inclination toward originality, a taste for research, and a desire to experience the incomparable gratification associated with the act of discovery itself.What medicines do not heal, the lance will; what the lance does not heal, fire will.Oersted would never have made his great discovery of the action of galvanic currents on magnets had he stopped in his researches to consider in what manner they could possibly be turned to practical account; and so we would not now be able to boast of the wonders done by the electric telegraphs. Indeed, no great law in Natural Philosophy has ever been discovered for its practical implications, but the instances are innumerable of investigations apparently quite useless in this narrow sense of the word which have led to the most valuable results.Since Pawlow and his pupils have succeeded in causing the secretion of saliva in the dog by means of optic and acoustic signals, it no longer seems strange to us that what the philosopher terms an \\'idea\\' is a process which can cause chemical changes in the body.I liked numbers because they were solid, invariant; they stood unmoved in a chaotic world. There was in numbers and their relation something absolute, certain, not to be questioned, beyond doubt.We humans have cooperative, selfless and loving moral instincts, the voice or expression of which we call our conscience—which is the complete opposite of competitive, selfish and aggressive instincts. As Charles Darwin said, \"The moral sense… affords the best and highest distinction between man and the lower animals.But at the same time, there must never be the least hesitation in giving up a position the moment it is shown to be untenable. It is not going too far to say that the greatness of a scientific investigator does not rest on the fact of his having never made a mistake, but rather on his readiness to admit that he has done so, whenever the contrary evidence is cogent enough.Nggak semua orang bisa diam di dalam batang kayu dua jam untuk memotret buaya dari jarak dekat. Kalau kamu nggak ambil foto ini, bagaimana kita bisa tahu rasanya kontak mata dengan buaya? Nggak semua orang bisa tahan berbulan-bulan di Arktik mengintil beruang kutub. Kalau nggak ada yang melakukannya, bagaimana orang di belahan dunia lain bisa tahu betapa penting dan indahnya beruang kutub? Bagi saya, fotografi wildlife adalah jembatan bagi orang banyak untuk bisa mengenal rumahnya sendiri. Bumi ini. I see our profession as an important bridge that connects Earth and human population. We\\'re the ambassador of natureThere is no division, in practice, between work and life. [An intellectual craft] is a practice that involves the whole person, continually drawing on past experience as it is projected into the future.The world has been changing even faster as people, devices and information are increasingly connected to each other. Computational power is growing and quantum computing is quickly being realised. This will revolutionise artificial intelligence with exponentially faster speeds. It will advance encryption. Quantum computers will change everything, even human biology. There is already one technique to edit DNA precisely, called CRISPR. The basis of this genome-editing technology is a bacterial defence system. It can accurately target and edit stretches of genetic code. The best intention of genetic manipulation is that modifying genes would allow scientists to treat genetic causes of disease by correcting gene mutations. There are, however, less noble possibilities for manipulating DNA. How far we can go with genetic engineering will become an increasingly urgent question. We can’t see the possibilities of curing motor neurone diseases—like my ALS—without also glimpsing its dangers.Intelligence is characterised as the ability to adapt to change. Human intelligence is the result of generations of natural selection of those with the ability to adapt to changed circumstances. We must not fear change. We need to make it work to our advantage.We all have a role to play in making sure that we, and the next generation, have not just the opportunity but the determination to engage fully with the study of science at an early level, so that we can go on to fulfil our potential and create a better world for the whole human race. We need to take learning beyond a theoretical discussion of how AI should be and to make sure we plan for how it can be. We all have the potential to push the boundaries of what is accepted, or expected, and to think big. We stand on the threshold of a brave new world. It is an exciting, if precarious, place to be, and we are the pioneers.When we invented fire, we messed up repeatedly, then invented the fire extinguisher. With more powerful technologies such as nuclear weapons, synthetic biology and strong artificial intelligence, we should instead plan ahead and aim to get things right the first time, because it may be the only chance we will get. Our future is a race between the growing power of our technology and the wisdom with which we use it. Let’s make sure that wisdom wins.Will it be possible to solve these problems? It is certain that nobody has thus far observed the transformation of dead into living matter, and for this reason we cannot form a definite plan for the solution of this problem of transformation. But we see that plants and animals during their growth continually transform dead into living matter, and that the chemical processes in living matter do not differ in principle from those in dead matter. There is, therefore, no reason to predict that abiogenesis is impossible, and I believe that it can only help science if the younger investigators realize that experimental abiogenesis is the goal of biology.If amino acids can only be made where there is no free oxygen in the atmosphere, and porphyrins can only be made when there is free oxygen, then these things needed by every cell could not have existed together to form the first cell! What’s more, many of these compounds are antagonistic. They will combine and destroy each other—anywhere except within a living cell.For, having begun to build their Tower of Babel without us, they will end in anthropophagy. And it is then that the beast will come crawling to us and lick our feet and spatter them with tears of blood from its eyes. And we shall sit upon the beast and raise the cup, and on it will be written: \"Mystery!If the business of physics is ever finished, the world will be a much less interesting place in which to live . . .The more ignorant we become the less value we set on science, and the less inclination we shall have to seek it.I often considered whether there could perhaps be found a more reasonable arrangement of circles.Being born as mediocre is fate, but to die as one is FAILURE.Even the truth is just a mere thought.Alfvén dismissed in his address religion as a \\'myth\\'...A man who wants the truth becomes a scientist; a man who wants to give free play to his subjectivity may become a writer; but what should a man do who wants something in between?Generally in life, knowledge is acquired to be used. But school learning more often fits Freire\\'s apt metaphor: knowledge is treated like money, to be put away in a bank for the future.Everything can\\'t be explained by some general biological phrase.His work seems to confirm my old axiom: it is useless to try to keep the whole body alive.Bohr\\'s standpoint, that a space-time description is impossible, I reject a limine. Physics does not consist only of atomic research, science does not consist only of physics, and life does not consist only of science. The aim of atomic research is to fit our empirical knowledge concerning it into our other thinking. All of this other thinking, so far as it concerns the outer world, is active in space and time. If it cannot be fitted into space and time, then it fails in its whole aim and one does not know what purpose it really serves.MakeNew FrNdS But Keep D oLd , One iS silVerThe Other is Gold.But in the early 1970s, we were not birdwatching. We were birding, and that made all the difference. We were out to seek, to discover, to chase, to learn, to find as many different kinds of birds as possible — and, in friendly competition, to try to find more of them than the next birder. We became a community of birders, with the complications that human societies always have; and although it was the birds that had brought us together, our story became a human story after all.It was during my enchanted days of travel that the idea came to me, which, through the years, has come into my thoughts again and again and always happily—the idea that geology is the music of the earth.I started studying law, but this I could stand just for one semester. I couldn\\'t stand more. Then I studied languages and literature for two years. After two years I passed an examination with the result I have a teaching certificate for Latin and Hungarian for the lower classes of the gymnasium, for kids from 10 to 14. I never made use of this teaching certificate. And then I came to philosophy, physics, and mathematics. In fact, I came to mathematics indirectly. I was really more interested in physics and philosophy and thought about those. It is a little shortened but not quite wrong to say: I thought I am not good enough for physics and I am too good for philosophy. Mathematics is in between....I am not, however, militant in my atheism. The great English theoretical physicist Paul Dirac is a militant atheist. I suppose he is interested in arguing about the existence of God. I am not. It was once quipped that there is no God and Dirac is his prophet.[On the practical applications of particle physics research with the Large Hadron Collider.]Sometimes the public says, \\'What\\'s in it for Numero Uno? Am I going to get better television reception? Am I going to get better Internet reception?\\' Well, in some sense, yeah. ... All the wonders of quantum physics were learned basically from looking at atom-smasher technology. ... But let me let you in on a secret: We physicists are not driven to do this because of better color television. ... That\\'s a spin-off. We do this because we want to understand our role and our place in the universe.Much later, when I discussed the problem with Einstein, he remarked that the introduction of the cosmological term was the biggest blunder he ever made in his life. But this \\'blunder,\\' rejected by Einstein, is still sometimes used by cosmologists even today, and the cosmological constant denoted by the Greek letter Λ rears its ugly head again and again and again.العلم يكتشف أما الفن فيبدع. إن ضوء النجم البعيد الذي إكتشفه العلم كان موجودا قبل إكتشافه, أما الضوء الذي يلقيه الفن علينا ، فقد أبدعه الفن بنفسه في اللحظة نفسها.To believe in nothing is as ridiculous as to believe in everything. Reason and factual evidence may convert a belief into knowledge.Where there has been true science, art has always been its exponent.Plenty of mathematicians, Hardy knew, could follow a step-by-step discursus unflaggingly—yet counted for nothing beside Ramanujan. Years later, he would contrive an informal scale of natural mathematical ability on which he assigned himself a 25 and Littlewood a 30. To David Hilbert, the most eminent mathematician of the day, he assigned an 80. To Ramanujan he gave 100.Hominids typically haven\\'t so much adapted to change, as they have accommodated to it.The human digestive tract is like the Amtrak line from Seattle to Los Angeles: transit time is about thirty hours, and the scenery on the last leg is pretty monotonous.إن الدين الذي يريد أن يستبدل التفكير الحر بأسرار صوفية ، وأن يستبدل الحقيقة العلمية بعقائد جامدة ، والفاعلية الإجتماعية بطقوس ، لابد أن يصطدم بالعلم. والدين الصحيح - على عكس هذا - فهو متسق مع العلم. وكثير من العلماء الكبار يسود عندهم الإعتراف بنوع من الوحدانية. وفوق هذا يستطيع العلم أن يساعدالدين في محاربة المعتقدات الخرافية ، فإذا إنفصلا يرتكس الدين في التخلف ويتجه العلم نخو الإلحاد.When we say two bodies \\'touch\\', what we mean (without knowing it) is that both electromagnetic fields are interacting to avoid physical interpenetration and ... that happens well before subatomic particles touch!It is curious that the human mind could blindly accept an infinite speed but had reservations to accept a finite one, simply because it was too large!إن التقدم العلمي مهما كان واضحاً بارزاً، لا يمكنه أن يجعل الأخلاق والدين غير ضروريين.فالعلم لا يعلم الناس كيف يحيون، ولا من شأنه أن يقدم لنا معايير قيمية. ذلك لأن القيم التي تسمو بالحياة الحيوانية إلى مستوى الحياة الإنسانية تبقى مجهولة وغير مفهومة بدون الدين. فالدين مدخل إلى عالم أخر متفوق على هذا العالم، والأخلاق هي معناه.If superstition could contradict science, the world may as well be on the back of a turtle. But giving into turtle worship was a bridge too far.Since 1849 I have studied incessantly, under all its aspects, a question which was already in my mind since 1832. I confess that my scheme is still a mere dream, and I do not shut my eyes to the fact that so long as I alone believe it to be possible, it is virtually impossible. ... The scheme in question is the cutting of a canal through the Isthmus of Suez. This has been thought of from the earliest historical times, and for that very reason is looked upon as impracticable. Geographical dictionaries inform us indeed that the project would have been executed long ago but for insurmountable obstacles. [On his inspiration for the Suez Canal.]If and when all the laws governing physical phenomena are finally discovered, and all the empirical constants occurring in these laws are finally expressed through the four independent basic constants, we will be able to say that physical science has reached its end, that no excitement is left in further explorations, and that all that remains to a physicist is either tedious work on minor details or the self-educational study and adoration of the magnificence of the completed system. At that stage physical science will enter from the epoch of Columbus and Magellan into the epoch of the National Geographic Magazine!While he attends to his rats, Persinger gives me the lowdown on the haunt theory. Why would a certain type of electromagnetic field make one hear things or sense a presence? What’s the mechanism? The answer hinges on the fact that exposure to electromagnetic fields lowers melatonin levels. Melatonin, he explains, is an anti-convulsive; if you have less of it in your system, your brain —in particular, your right temporal lobe— will be more prone to tiny epileptic-esque microseizures and the subtle hallucinations these seizures can cause.During the first half of the present century we had an Alexander von Humboldt, who was able to scan the scientific knowledge of his time in its details, and to bring it within one vast generalization. At the present juncture, it is obviously very doubtful whether this task could be accomplished in a similar way, even by a mind with gifts so peculiarly suited for the purpose as Humboldt\\'s was, and if all his time and work were devoted to the purpose.Dermatology ... this young daughter of medicine ...It is to these two discoveries by Bradley that we owe the exactness of modern astronomy. .... This double service assures to their discoverer the most distinguished place (after Hipparchus and Kepler) above the greatest astronomers of all ages and all countries.Every time we proceed to explain some conjectural law or theory by a new conjectural theory of a higher degree of universality, we are discovering more about the world, trying to penetrate deeper into its secrets. And every time we succeed in falsifying a theory of this kind, we make an important new discovery. For these falsifications are most important. They teach us the unexpected; and they reassure us that, although our theories are made by ourselves, although they are our own inventions, they are none the less genuine assertions about the world; for they can clash with something we never made.Imagine for a moment that we are nothing but the product of billions of years of molecules coming together and ratcheting up through natural selection, that we are composed only of highways of fluids and chemicals sliding along roadways within billions of dancing cells, that trillions of synaptic conversations hum in parallel, that this vast egglike fabric of micron-thin circuitry runs algorithms undreamt of in modern science, and that these neural programs give rise to our decision making, loves, desires, fears, and aspirations. To me, that understanding would be a numinous experience, better than anything ever proposed in anyone\\'s holy text.How often people speak of art and science as though they were two entirely different things, with no interconnection. An artist is emotional, they think, and uses only his intuition; he sees all at once and has no need of reason. A scientist is cold, they think, and uses only his reason; he argues carefully step by step, and needs no imagination. That is all wrong. The true artist is quite rational as well as imaginative and knows what he is doing; if he does not, his art suffers. The true scientist is quite imaginative as well as rational, and sometimes leaps to solutions where reason can follow only slowly; if he does not, his science suffers.When we look up at night and view the stars, everything we see is shinning because of distant nuclear fusion.How came the bodies of animals to be contrived with so much art, and for what ends were their several parts?Was the eye contrived without skill in Opticks, and the ear without knowledge of sounds?...and these things being rightly dispatch’d, does it not appear from phænomena that there is a Being incorporeal, living, intelligent...?And you are made of a hundred trillion cells. We are, each of us, a multitude.God without dominion, providence, and final causes, is nothing else but Fate and Nature. Blind metaphysical necessity, which is certainly the same always and everywhere, could produce no variety of things. All that diversity of natural things which we find suited to different times and places could arise from nothing but the ideas and will of a Being necessarily existing.Science is a way to call the bluff of those who only pretend to knowledge. It is a bulwark against mysticism, against superstition, against religion misapplied to where it has no business being.Of course, supernatural acts are what miracles are all about. They are, after all, precisely those things that circumvent the laws of nature. A god who can create the laws of nature can presumably also circumvent them at will. Although why they would have been circumvented so liberally thousands of years ago, before the invention of modern communication instruments that could have recorded them, and not today, is still something to wonder about.Every atom you possess has almost certainly passed through several stars and been part of millions of organisms on its way to becoming you. We are each so atomically numerous and so vigorously recycled at death that a significant number of our atoms - up to a billion for each of us, it has been suggested - probably once belonged to Shakespeare. A billion more each came from Buddha and Genghis Khan and Beethoven, and any other historical figure you care to name. So we are all reincarnations - though short-lived ones. When we die, our atoms will disassemble and move off to find new uses elsewhere - as part of a leaf or other human being or drop of dew.The more you delve into science, the more it appears to rely on faith.When man becomes greater than nature, nature, which gave us birth, will respond.Metaphysical speculation is independent of the physical validity of the Big Bang itself and is irrelevant to our understanding of it.Geography is the key, the crucial accident of birth. A piece of protein could be a snail, a sea lion, or a systems analyst, but it had to start somewhere. This is not science; it is merely metaphor. And the landscape in which the protein \"starts\" shapes its end as surely as bowls shape water.......Don\\'t they know science doesn\\'t work like that? You can\\'t just order scientific breakthroughs. They happen when you are looking at something you\\'ve been working on for years and suddenly see a connection you never noticed before, or when you\\'re looking for something else altogether. Sometimes they even happen by accident. Don\\'t they know you can\\'t get a scientific breakthrough just because you want one?A curious aspect of the theory of evolution is that everybody thinks he understands it.Arabic science throughout its golden age was inextricably linked to religion; indeed, it was driven by the need of early scholars to interpret the Qur\\'an.Eve and the apple was the first great step in experimental science.Sometime I\\'m going to do an essay called \\'The Virtues of Amateurism\\' for all of those people who wish they earned their living in the arts. The market kills more artistic people than anything else. It\\'s a world of safety out there, for most people. They want safety, the magazines and manufacturers give them safety, give them homogeneity, give them the familiar and comfortable, don\\'t challenge them.Science says the first word on everything, and the last word on nothing.The void is \\'not-being,\\' and no part of \\'what is\\' is a \\'not-being,\\'; for what \\'is\\' in the strict sense of the term is an absolute plenum. This plenum, however, is not \\'one\\': on the contrary, it is a \\'many\\' infinite in number and invisible owing to the minuteness of their bulk.Man has a tyrant, ignorance. I voted for the demise of that particular tyrant. That particular tyrant has engendered royalty, which is authority based on falsehood, whereas science is authority based on truth. Man should be governed by science alone.\"\"And conscience,\" added the bishop. \"It\\'s the same thing. Conscience is the quota of innate science we each have inside us.The denier that ID [intelligent design] is science faces the following dilemma. Either he admits that the intervention of such a designer is possible, or he does not. If he does not, he must explain why that belief is more scientific than the belief that a designer is possible. If on the other hand he believes that a designer is possible, then he can argue that the evidence is overwhelmingly against the actions of such a designer, but he cannot say that someone who offers evidence on the other side is doing something of a fundamentally different kind. All he can say about that person is that he is scientifically mistaken.Birth after birth the line unchanging runs,And fathers live transmitted in their sons;Each passing year beholds the unvarying kinds,The same their manners, and the same their minds:Till, as erelong successive buds decay,And insect-shoals successive pass away,Increasing wants the pregnant parent vexWith the fond wish to form a softer sex. .. One sometimes finds what one is not looking for Comprehending and knowing better and deeper are the best guarantees we can have to attain ideas and criteria of our own; i.e. to stop depending on what other people say. In summary, to be freer to choose our own path in life.Subjectivity is strange to Science, while Relativity is an objective part of it.Truth is not as pompous and romantic as myth ... but it has the immeasurable value of being the Truth.Besides our eyes, skin and the other senses through which we receive the shadows of the exterior reality, we have a \\'mental eye\\' (intelligence) with which we can perceive reality as it is.A ști anumite lucruri pe de rost îți conferă capacitatea unei înțelegeri superioare.There are, of course, inherent tendencies to repetition in music itself. Our poetry, our ballads, our songs are full of repetition; nursery rhymes and the little chants and songs we use to teach young children have choruses and refrains. We are attracted to repetition, even as adults; we want the stimulus and the reward again and again, and in music we get it. Perhaps, therefore, we should not be surprised, should not complain if the balance sometimes shifts too far and our musical sensitivity becomes a vulnerability.The propensity to excessive simplification is indeed natural to the mind of man, since it is only by abstraction and generalisation, which necessarily imply the neglect of a multitude of particulars, that he can stretch his puny faculties so as to embrace a minute portion of the illimitable vastness of the universe. But if the propensity is natural and even inevitable, it is nevertheless fraught with peril, since it is apt to narrow and falsify our conception of any subject under investigation. To correct it partially - for to correct it wholly would require an infinite intelligence - we must endeavour to broaden our views by taking account of a wide range of facts and possibilities; and when we have done so to the utmost of our power, we must still remember that from the very nature of things our ideas fall immeasurably short of the reality.... informed ignorance provides the natural state of mind for research scientists at the ever-shifting frontiers of knowledge. People who believe themselves ignorant of nothing have neither looked for, nor stumbled upon, the boundary between what is known and unknown in the cosmos.For me, I think the greatest achievements of science is to allow humanity to realize that our world is comprehensible. Through science, rational thinking, we can understand how the universe works.If we want to set out on the aruous search for the truth, we must all summon up the courage to leave the lines along which we have thought until now and as the first step begin to doubt everything that we previously accepted as correct and true. Can we still afford to close our eyes and stop up our ears because new ideas are supposed to be heretical and absurd?The whole [scientific] process resembles biological evolution. A problem is like an ecological niche, and a theory is like a gene or a species which is being tested for viability in that niche.Politics is for the moment and equation is for eternity.I think you\\'ll find it\\'s a bit more complicated than that.The Himalayas are the crowning achievement of the Indo-Australian plate. India in the Oligocene crashed head on into Tibet, hit so hard that it not only folded and buckled the plate boundaries but also plowed into the newly created Tibetan plateau and drove the Himalayas five and a half miles into the sky. The mountains are in some trouble. India has not stopped pushing them, and they are still going up. Their height and volume are already so great they are beginning to melt in their own self-generated radioactive heat. When the climbers in 1953 planted their flags on the highest mountain, they set them in snow over the skeletons of creatures that had lived in a warm clear ocean that India, moving north, blanked out. Possibly as much as 20,000 feet below the sea floor, the skeletal remains had turned into rock. This one fact is a treatise in itself on the movements of the surface of the earth. If by some fiat, I had to restrict all this writing to one sentence; this is the one I would choose: the summit of Mount Everest is marine limestone.Now and again, one could detect in a childless woman of a certain age the various characteristics of all the children she had never issued. Her body was haunted by the ghost of souls who hadn\\'t lived yet. Premature ghosts. Half-ghosts. X\\'s without Y\\'s. Y\\'s without X\\'s. They applied at her womb and were denied, but, meant for her and no one else, they wouldn\\'t go away. Like tiny ectoplasmic gophers, they hunkered in her tear ducts. They shone through her sighs. Often to her chagrin, they would soften the voice she used in the marketplace. When she spilled wine, it was their playful antics that jostled the glass. They called out her name in the bath or when she passed real children in the street. The spirit babies were everywhere her companions, and everywhere they left her lonesome - yet they no more bore her resentment than a seed resents uneaten fruit. Like pet gnats, like phosphorescence, like sighs on a string, they would follow her into eternity.The features of character are carved out of adversity.The physical sciences, good and innocent in themselves, had already... begun to be warped, had been subtly manoeuvred in a certain direction. Despair of objective truth had been increasingly insinuated into the scientists; indifference to it, and a concentration upon mere power, had been the result… The very experiences of the dissecting room and the pathological laboratory were breeding a conviction that the stifling of all deep-set repugnances was the first essential for progress.Tell me what you eat and I will tell you who you are.In all, 86 per cent of the increased life expectancy was due to decreases in infectious diseases. And the bulk of the decline in infectious disease deaths occurred prior to the age of antibiotics. Less than 4 per cent of the total improvement in life expectancy since 1700s can be credited to twentieth-century advances in medical care.In order to disprove the assertion that all crows are black, one white crow is sufficient.I believe in spectacles, but I think eyes necessary too.It seemed to a number of philosophers of language, myself included, that we should attempt to achieve a unification of Chomsky\\'s syntax, with the results of the researches that were going on in semantics and pragmatics. I believe that this effort has proven to be a failure. Though Chomsky did indeed revolutionize the subject of linguistics, it is not at all clear, at the end the century, what the solid results of this revolution are. As far as I can tell there is not a single rule of syntax that all, or even most, competent linguists are prepared to agree is a rule.Lots of things are mystries. But that doesn\\'t mean there isn\\'t an answer to them. It\\'s just that scientists haven\\'t found the answer yet.Mere lack of evidence, of course, is no reason to denounce a theory. Look at intelligent design. The fact that it is bollocks hasn’t stopped a good many people from believing in it. Darwinism itself is only supported by tons of evidence, which is a clear indication that Darwin didn’t write his books himself.Penegakan sistem Islam dan pemberlakuan syariat Islam tidak dapat dilakukan dengan cara merebut kekuasaan yang datang dari lapisan atas. Akan tetapi, melalui perubahan masyarakat secara keseluruhan—atau pemahaman beberapa kelompok masyarakat dalam jumlah yang mencukupi untuk mengarahkan seluruh masyarakat—pada pemikirannya, nilai-nilainya, akhlaknya, dan komitmennya dengan Islam. Sehingga tumbuh kesadaran dalam jiwa mereka, bahwa menegakkan sistem dan syariat Islam itu merupakan sebuah kewajiban yang harus dilaksanakan.A new concept of god: “something not very different from the sum total of the physical laws of the universe; that is, gravitation plus quantum mechanics plus grand unified field theories plus a few other things equaled god. And by that all they meant was that here were a set of exquisitely powerful physical principles that seemed to explain a great deal that was otherwise inexplicable about the universe. Laws of nature…that apply not just locally, not just in Glasgow, but far beyond: Edinburgh, Moscow…Mars…the center of the Milky Way, and out by the most distant quarters known. That the same laws of physics apply everywhere is quite remarkable. Certainly that represents a power greater than any of us.The problem with ID, of course, is that it leaves open the possibility that the intelligence behind nature may have a moral interest in us, having communicated already with humanity in the past, and might try to boss you around in your private affairs.With hypothetical advanced aliens residing at a safely distant address in the hypothetical multiverse, that is - to the relief of folks like Gribbin, Dawkins and the New Scientist - manifestly not the case.When the conventional wisdom of physics seemed to conflict with an elegant theory of his, Einstein was inclined to question that wisdom rather than his theory, often to have his stubbornness rewarded.... nothing in Nature is black or white, few solutions are clean and clear; rather, reality, and especially our models of it, possess shades of gray throughout.I believe the visionaries and true reflections of society will be rewarded after their lives.

I was hooked.Science is a hammer for

field sure the universe is full of intelligent life just been too intelligent to come are just an advanced breed of monkeys on minor planet of very average star But we can understand the Universe That makes us something very and religion are not at odds Science is simply too young to the beginning there was nothing which which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without my soul may set in darkness it will rise in perfect light have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the must be made as simple as possible But not simpler man who dares to waste one hour of time has not

not only compatible with spirituality it is profound source of assumptions are your windows on the world them off every once in while or the light come is big You just believe how vastly hugely big it is mean you may think long way down the road to the but just peanuts to have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of you wish to make an apple pie from scratch you must first invent the universe thinker sees his own actions as experiments and attempts to find out something Success and failure are for him answers above would be possible to describe everything scientifically but it would make no sense it would be without meaning as if you described symphony as variation of wave are going to die and that makes us the lucky ones Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than scientists greater than We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our so massively exceeds the set of actual people In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and in our ordinariness that are privileged few who won the lottery of birth against all odds how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred Life would be tragic if it me it is far better to grasp the Universe as it really is than to persist in delusion however satisfying and sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from never change things by fighting the existing change something build new model that makes the existing model is like sex sure it may give some practical results but not why we do claims require extraordinary evidence believe there is another world waiting for us better world And be waiting for you this is it said We are going to die Yes said except no Wait minute He suddenly lunged across the chamber at something behind line of vision this switch he cried What Where cried twisting round No was only fooling said we are going to die after is more humble The scientist who looks at the universe with an open mind and accepts whatever the universe has to teach us or somebody who says everything in this book must be considered the literal truth and never mind the fallibility of all the human beings involved can see how it might be possible for man to look down upon the earth and be an atheist but cannot conceive how man could look up into the heavens and say there is no my opinion we devote nearly enough scientific research to finding cure for you know what we call opinion in the absence of evidence We call it you try and take cat apart to see how it works the first thing you have on your hands is is not product of schooling but of the lifelong attempt to acquire are an impossibility in an impossible science it often happens that scientists say You know really good argument my position is mistaken and then they would actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again They really do it It happen as often as it should because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful But it happens every day cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or after all how do we know that two and two make four Or that the force of gravity works Or that the past is unchangeable If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind and if the mind itself is controllable what then have friend an artist and has sometimes taken view which agree with very well hold up flower and say look how beautiful it is and agree Then he says as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as scientist take this all apart and it becomes dull thing and think that kind of nutty First of all the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too believe Although may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is can appreciate the beauty of flower At the same time see much more about the flower than he sees could imagine the cells in there the complicated actions inside which also have beauty mean not just beauty at this dimension at one centimeter also beauty at smaller dimensions the inner structure also the processes The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting it means that insects can see the color It adds question does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms Why is it aesthetic All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement the mystery and the awe of flower It only adds understand how it the irrational however seductive the transcendent and all who invite you to subordinate or annihilate yourself Distrust compassion prefer dignity for yourself and others be afraid to be thought arrogant or selfish Picture all experts as if they were mammals Never be spectator of unfairness or stupidity Seek out argument and disputation for their own sake the grave will supply plenty of time for silence Suspect your own motives and all excuses Do not live for others any more than you would expect others to live for does not play dice with the investigates religion interprets Science gives man knowledge which is power religion gives man wisdom which is control Science deals mainly with facts religion deals mainly with values The two are not rivals suppose it is tempting if the only tool you have is hammer to treat everything as if it were most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is at all is not only compatible with spirituality it is profound source of spirituality When we recognize our place in an immensity of light years and in the passage of ages when we grasp the intricacy beauty and subtlety of life then that soaring feeling that sense of elation and humility combined is surely spiritual So are our emotions in the presence of great art or music or literature or acts of exemplary selfless courage such as those of or King The notion that science and spirituality are somehow mutually exclusive does disservice to after certain age diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of problem often not discovered until late in life is that when you look for things in life like love meaning motivation it implies they are sitting behind tree or under rock The most successful people in life recognize that in life they create their own love they manufacture their own meaning they generate their own motivation For me am driven by two main philosophies know more today about the world than knew yesterday And lessen the suffering of others be surprised how far that gets you do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense reason and intellect has intended us to forgo their use like the scientific spirit the holding off the being sure but not too sure the willingness to surrender ideas when the evidence is against them this is ultimately fine it always keeps the way beyond open always gives life thought affection the whole man chance to try over again after mistake after wrong guess am an atheist out and out It took me long time to say it been an atheist for years and years but somehow felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist because it assumed knowledge that one have Somehow it was better to say one was humanist or an agnostic finally decided that creature of emotion as well as of reason Emotionally am an atheist have the evidence to prove that God exist but so strongly suspect he that want to waste my are stuck with technology when what we really want is just stuff that works learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to these the same questions as last physics final exam Yes But this year the answers are atom in your body came from star that exploded And the atoms in your left hand probably came from different star than your right hand It really is the most poetic thing know about physics You are all stardust You couldn be here if stars hadn exploded because the elements the carbon nitrogen oxygen iron all the things that matter for evolution and for life weren created at the beginning of time They were created in the nuclear furnaces of stars and the only way for them to get into your body is if those stars were kind enough to explode So forget The stars died so that you could be here or not you believe in God you must believe this when we as species abandon our trust in power greater than us we abandon our sense of accountability Faiths all faiths are admonitions that there is something we cannot understand something to which we are accountable With faith we are accountable to each other to ourselves and to higher truth Religion is flawed but only because man is flawed The church consists of brotherhood of imperfect simple souls wanting only to be voice of compassion in world spinning out of can judge our progress by the courage of our questions and the depth of our answers our willingness to embrace what is true rather than what feels if there is only one possible unified theory it is just set of rules and equations What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes universe for them to describe The usual approach of science of constructing mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be universe for the model to describe Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing You will be required to do wrong no matter where you go It is the basic condition of life to be required to violate your own identity At some time every creature which lives must do so It is the ultimate shadow the defeat of creation this is the curse at work the curse that feeds on all life Everywhere in the the standpoint of daily life however there is one thing we do know that we are here for the sake of each other above all for those upon whose smile and our own happiness depends and also for the countless unknown souls with whose fate we are connected by bond of sympathy Many times day realize how much my own outer and inner life is built upon the labors of my fellow men both living and dead and how earnestly must exert myself in order to give in return as much as have have calculated that the chances of something so patently absurd actually existing are millions to magicians have calculated that chances crop up nine times out of ten reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth Authoritarian institutions and marketers have always known this more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge it is those who know little not those who know much who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science accept the currently fashionable assertion that any view is automatically as worthy of respect as any equal and opposite view My view is that the moon is made of rock If someone says to me Well you been there have you You seen it for yourself so my view that it is made of Cheese is equally valid then even be bothered to argue There is such thing as the burden of proof and in the case of god as in the case of the composition of the moon this has shifted radically God used to be the best explanation got and now got vastly better ones God is no longer an explanation of anything but has instead become something that would itself need an insurmountable amount of explaining So think that being convinced that there is no god is as irrational or arrogant point of view as belief that there is think the matter calls for at day science begins to study phenomena it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its millions of years mankind lived just like the animals Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination We learned to talk and we learned to listen Speech has allowed the communication of ideas enabling human beings to work together to build the impossible greatest achievements have come about by talking and its greatest failures by not talking It have to be like this Our greatest hopes could become reality in the future With the technology at our disposal the possibilities are unbounded All we need to do is make sure we keep talking want to believe want to scientist is not person who gives the right answers one who asks the right is organized knowledge Wisdom is organized life pessimist because of intelligence but an optimist because of will do not know what may appear to the world but to myself seem to have been only like boy playing on the and diverting myself in now and then finding smoother pebble or prettier shell than ordinary whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before opposite of correct statement is false statement But the opposite of profound truth may well be another profound dreadful are the curses which lays on its votaries Besides the fanatical frenzy which is as dangerous in man as hydrophobia in dog there is this fearful fatalistic apathy The effects are apparent in many countries habits slovenly systems of agriculture sluggish methods of commerce and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement the next of its dignity and sanctity The fact that in law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property either as child wife or concubine must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of has ceased to be great power among men Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith all know how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it No stronger retrograde force exists in the world Far from being moribund is militant and proselytizing faith It has already spread throughout Central raising fearless warriors at every step and were it not that is sheltered in the strong arms of science the science against which it had vainly struggled the civilisation of modern might fall as fell the civilisation of ancient are way for the cosmos to know my lad is made up of mistakes but they are mistakes which it is useful to make because they lead little by little to the from the war of nature from famine and death the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving namely the production of the higher animals directly follows There is grandeur in this view of life with its several powers having been originally breathed into few forms or into one and that whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity from so simple beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been and are being paradox of freedom is the argument that freedom in the sense of absence of any constraining control must lead to very great restraint since it makes the bully free to enslave the meek The idea is in slightly different form and with very different tendency clearly expressed in well known is the paradox of tolerance Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant if we are not prepared to defend tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant then the tolerant will be destroyed and tolerance with them In this formulation do not imply for instance that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion suppression would certainly be unwise But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument but begin by denouncing all argument they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument because it is deceptive and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols We should therefore claim in the name of tolerance the right not to tolerate the intolerant We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder or to kidnapping or to the revival of the slave trade as most merciful thing in the world think is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality and of our frightful position therein that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of new Dark is interesting and if you agree you can fuck was quoting former editor of New Scientist Magazine who is as yet unidentified possibly If there is any religion that could respond to the needs of modern science it would be we read another person thinks for us we merely repeat his mental process In learning to write the pupil goes over with his pen what the teacher has outlined in pencil so in reading the greater part of the work of thought is already done for us This is why it relieves us to take up book after being occupied with our own thoughts And in reading the mind is in fact only the playground of another thoughts So it comes about that if anyone spends almost the whole day in reading and by way of relaxation devotes the intervals to some thoughtless pastime he gradually loses the capacity for thinking just as the man who always rides at last forgets how to walk This is the case with many learned persons they have read themselves inappropriate to call this planet Earth when it is clearly is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded This is better than we thought The Universe is much bigger than our prophets said grander more subtle more elegant The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious It is the source of all true art and all science He to whom this emotion is stranger who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe is as good as dead his eyes are civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions any more than our opinions in physics or geometry Rest is not idleness and to lie sometimes on the grass under trees on day listening to the murmur of the water or watching the clouds float across the sky is by no means waste of is absurd for the to complain that it is unthinkable for an admittedly unthinkable God to make everything out of nothing and then pretend that it is more thinkable that nothing should turn itself into is universal Our specific methods for understanding it are arbitrary Some of us pray to some of us go to some of us study subatomic particles In the end we are all just searching for truth that which is greater than time will come when diligent research over long periods will bring to light things which now lie hidden single lifetime even though entirely devoted to the sky would not be enough for the investigation of so vast subject And so this knowledge will be unfolded only through long successive ages There will come time when our descendants will be amazed that we did not know things that are so plain to them Many discoveries are reserved for ages still to come when memory of us will have been me tutor said Is revenge science or an art Religion is culture of faith science is culture of doubt really know why it is that all of us are so committed to the sea except think because in addition to the fact that the sea changes and the light changes and ships change because we all came from the sea And it is an interesting biological fact that all of us have in our veins the exact same percentage of salt in our blood that exists in the ocean and therefore we have salt in our blood in our sweat in our tears We are tied to the ocean And when we go back to the sea whether it is to sail or to watch it we are going back from whence we came Remarks at the Dinner for the Cup First we thought the was calculator Then we found out how to turn numbers into letters with and we thought it was typewriter Then we discovered graphics and we thought it was television With the World Wide realized is unquestionably one of the purest and highest elements in human happiness It trains the mind through the eye and the eye through the mind As the sun colors flowers so does art color question is the most difficult in the world It is not question can answer simply with yes or no am not an Atheist do not know if can define myself as The problem involved is too vast for our limited minds May not reply with parable The human mind no matter how highly trained cannot grasp the universe We are in the position of little child entering huge library whose walls are covered to the ceiling with books in many different tongues The child knows that someone must have written those books It does not know who or how It does not understand the languages in which they are written The child notes definite plan in the arrangement of the books mysterious order which it does not comprehend but only dimly suspects That it seems to me is the attitude of the human mind even the greatest and most cultured toward God We see universe marvelously arranged obeying certain laws but we understand the laws only dimly Our limited minds cannot grasp the mysterious force that sways the constellations am fascinated by admire even more his contributions to modern thought is the greatest of modern philosophers because he is the first philosopher who deals with the soul and the body as one not as two separate science of government it is my duty to study more than all other sciences the arts of legislation and administration and negotiation ought to take the place of indeed exclude in manner all other arts must study politics and war that our sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy Our sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy geography natural history and naval architecture navigation commerce and agriculture in order to give their children right to study painting poetry music architecture statuary tapestry and do not join hands every and sing Yes gravity is real know gravity is real will have faith believe in my heart that what goes up up up must come down down down If they did we would think they were pretty insecure about the the people who believe such things and who are not ashamed to ignore totally all the patient findings of thinking minds through all the centuries since the Bible was written And it is these ignorant people the most uneducated the most unimaginative the most unthinking among us who would make themselves the guides and leaders of us all who would force their feeble and childish beliefs on us who would invade our schools and libraries and homes personally resent it more learn about the universe the less convinced am that any sort of benevolent force that has anything to do with it at all would rather have questions that be answered than answers that be sense and sense of humor are the same thing moving at different speeds sense of humor is just common sense dancing believe the simplest explanation is there is no God No one created the universe and no one directs our fate This leads me to profound realization that there probably is no heaven and no afterlife either We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe and for that am extremely are three stages in scientific discovery First people deny that it is true then they deny that it is important finally they credit the wrong is impossible to escape the impression that people commonly use false standards of measurement that they seek power success and wealth for themselves and admire them in others and that they underestimate what is of true value in just science that we understand total amount of suffering per year in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation During the minute that it takes me to compose this sentence thousands of animals are being eaten alive many others are running for their lives whimpering with fear others are slowly being devoured from within by rasping parasites thousands of all kinds are dying of starvation thirst and disease It must be so If there ever is time of plenty this very fact will automatically lead to an increase in the population until the natural state of starvation and misery is restored In universe of electrons and selfish genes blind physical forces and genetic replication some people are going to get hurt other people are going to get lucky and you find any rhyme or reason in it nor any justice The universe that we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is at bottom no design no purpose no evil no good nothing but pitiless thing have learned in long life that all our science measured against reality is primitive and childlike and yet it is the most precious thing we have Religion Your reason is now mature enough to examine this object In the first place divest yourself of all bias in favor of novelty singularity of opinion shake off all the fears servile prejudices under which weak minds are servilely crouched Fix reason firmly in her seat and call to her tribunal every fact every opinion Question with boldness even the existence of God because if there be one he must more approve of the homage of reason than that of blindfolded fear You will naturally examine first the religion of your own country Read the Bible then as you would read or The facts which are within the ordinary course of nature you will believe on the authority of the writer as you do those of the same kind in and The testimony of the writer weighs in their favor in one scale and their not being against the laws of nature does not weigh against them But those facts in the Bible which contradict the laws of nature must be examined with more care and under variety of faces Here you must recur to the pretensions of the writer to inspiration from God Examine upon what evidence his pretensions are founded and whether that evidence is so strong as that its falsehood would be more improbable than change in the laws of nature in the case he relates For example in the book of we are told the sun stood still several hours Were we to read that fact in or we should class it with their showers of blood speaking of statues beasts But it is said that the writer of that book was inspired Examine therefore candidly what evidence there is of his having been inspired The pretension is entitled to your inquiry because millions believe it On the other hand you are astronomer enough to know how contrary it is to the law of nature that body revolving on its axis as the earth does should have stopped should not by that sudden stoppage have prostrated animals trees buildings and should after certain time have resumed its revolution that without second general prostration Is this arrest of the motion or the evidence which affirms it most within the law of probabilities You will next read the New It is the history of personage called Keep in your eye the opposite pretensions of those who say he was begotten by God born of virgin suspended reversed the laws of nature at will ascended bodily into heaven and of those who say he was man of illegitimate birth of benevolent heart enthusiastic mind who set out without pretensions to divinity ended in believing them and was punished capitally for sedition by being gibbeted according to the law which punished the first commission of that offence by whipping the second by exile or death in fureâ Do not be frightened from this inquiry by any fear of its consequences If it ends in belief that there is no God you will find incitements to virtue in the comfort and pleasantness you feel in its exercise and the love of others which it will procure you In fine repeat you must lay aside all prejudice on both sides and neither believe nor reject anything because any other persons or description of persons have rejected or believed it forgot to observe when speaking of the New that you should read all the histories of as well of those whom council of ecclesiastics have decided for us to be as those they named Evangelists Because these pretended to inspiration as much as the others and you are to judge their pretensions by your own reason and not by the reason of those ecclesiastics Most of these are lost Letter to his nephew advising him in matters of religion number of years ago when was instructor met for the first time certain eminent historian of science At the time could only regard him with tolerant condescension was sorry of the man who it seemed to me was forced to hover about the edges of science He was compelled to shiver endlessly in the outskirts getting only feeble warmth from the distant sun of science while just beginning my research was bathed in the heady liquid heat up at the very center of the lifetime of being wrong at many point was never more wrong It was not he who was wandering in the periphery It was he not who lived in the blaze had fallen victim to the fallacy of the growing edge the belief that only the very frontier of scientific advance counted that everything that had been left behind by that advance was faded and is that true Because tree in spring buds and comes greenly into leaf are those leaves therefore the tree If the newborn twigs and their leaves were all that existed they would form vague halo of green suspended in but surely that is not the tree The leaves by themselves are no more than trivial fluttering decoration It is the trunk and limbs that give the tree its grandeur and the leaves themselves their is not discovery in science however revolutionary however sparkling with insight that does not arise out of what went before If have seen further than other men said it is because have stood on the shoulders of is an attempt to get control over the sensory world in which we are placed by means of the which we have developed inside us as result of biological and psychological necessities But it cannot achieve its end Its doctrines carry with them the stamp of the times in which they originated the ignorant childhood days of the human race Its consolations deserve no trust Experience teaches us that the world is not nursery The ethical commands to which religion seeks to lend its weight require some other foundations instead for human society cannot do without them and it is dangerous to link up obedience to them with religious belief If one attempts to assign to religion its place in man evolution it seems not so much to be lasting acquisition as parallel to the neurosis which the civilized individual must pass through on his way from childhood to beauty of living thing is not the atoms that go into it but the way those atoms are put is follow me closely here the science is pretty complicated if cut hole in the the air stay inside anymore In the Universe it may be that Primitive life is very common and intelligent life is fairly rare Some would say it has yet to occur on again at that dot here home us On it everyone you love everyone you know everyone you ever heard

stars in the typical galaxy We are each of us little in the back of our minds we already understand without all the science discussed that something terribly wrong is happening Our sustenance now comes from misery We know that if someone offers to show us film on how our meat is produced it will be horror film We perhaps know more than we care to admit keeping it down in the dark places of our memory disavowed When we eat meat we live literally on tortured flesh Increasingly that tortured flesh is becoming our own The Old Astronomer to His Pupil Reach me down my would know him when we meet

It is strange the pearly planet should look red as fiery God will mercifully guide me on my way amongst the who is not satisfied with little is satisfied with nothing consider it an extremely dangerous doctrine because the more likely we are to assume that the solution comes from the outside the less likely we are to solve our problems sounds like but not only that this story of what man by his science and practical inventions has achieved on this earth where he first appeared as weakly member of the animal kingdom and on which each individual of his species must ever again appear as helpless infant is direct fulfilment of all or of most of the dearest wishes in his All these possessions he has acquired through culture Long ago he formed an ideal conception of omnipotence and omniscience which he embodied in his gods Whatever seemed unattainable to his desires or forbidden to him he attributed to these gods One may say therefore that these gods were the ideals of his culture Now he has himself approached very near to realizing this ideal he has nearly become god himself But only it is true in the way that ideals are usually realized in the general experience of humanity Not completely in some respects not at all in others only by halves Man has become god by means of artificial limbs so to speak quite magnificent when equipped with all his accessory organs but they do not grow on him and they still give him trouble at times Future ages will produce further great advances in this realm of culture probably inconceivable now and will increase likeness to god still invent you need good imagination and pile of know very little and yet it is astonishing that we know so much and still more astonishing that so little knowledge can give us so much power suppose therefore that all things see are illusions believe that nothing has ever existed of everything my lying memory tells me think have no senses believe that body shape extension motion location are functions What is there then that can be taken as true Perhaps only this one thing that nothing at all is our science is no illusion But an illusion it would be to suppose that what science cannot give us we can get an instructive curious spectacle and conflict Science twin in its fields of Democracy in its Science testing absolutely all thoughts all works has already burst well upon the world sun mounting most illuminating most glorious surely never again to set But against it deeply holding possession yet remains not only through the churches and schools but by imaginative literature and unregenerate poetry the fossil theology of the superstitious untaught and credulous primitive ages of work and love would add two other ingredients that give meaning to life First to fulfill whatever talents we are born with However blessed we are by fate with different abilities and strengths we should try to develop them to the fullest rather than allow them to atrophy and decay We all know individuals who did not fulfill the promise they showed in childhood Many of them became haunted by the image of what they might have become Instead of blaming fate think we should accept ourselves as we are and try to fulfill whatever dreams are within our we should try to leave the world better place than when we entered it As individuals we can make difference whether it is to probe the secrets of Nature to clean up the environment and work for peace and social justice or to nurture the inquisitive vibrant spirit of the young by being mentor and flies you to the moon Religion flies you into buildings process cannot be understood by stopping it Understanding must move with the flow of the process must join it and flow with it went to school in drag in art school and my day was completely different because everybody thought was chick You should see me as chick So went as girl as like an experiment and it worked really well and everyone was really nice to me but talk obviously you know train conductors were really cool to me on my commute looked hot as chick We are trying to prove ourselves wrong as quickly as possible because only in that way can we find questions of science the authority of thousand is not worth the humble reasoning of single religious convictions and scientific views cannot at present be more specifically defined than as those of believer in creative evolution desire that no public monument or work of art or inscription or sermon or ritual service commemorating me shall suggest that accepted the tenets peculiar to any established church or denomination nor take the form of cross or any other instrument of torture or symbol of blood sacrifice From the will of would request that my body in death be buried not cremated so that the energy content contained within it gets returned to the earth so that flora and fauna can dine upon it just as have dined upon flora and fauna during my saw the apple fall was the only one who asked why The advancement of science and the diffusion of information is the best aliment to true now know the basic rules governing the universe together with the gravitational interrelationships of its gross components as shown in the theory of relativity worked out between and We also know the basic rules governing the subatomic particles and their interrelationships since these are very neatly described by the quantum theory worked out between and more we have found that the galaxies and clusters of galaxies are the basic units of the physical universe as discovered between and The young specialist in Lit having quoted me went on to lecture me severely on the fact that in every century people have thought they understood the universe at last and in every century they were proved to be wrong It follows that the one thing we can say about our modern knowledge is that it is wrong My answer to him was when people thought the Earth was flat they were wrong When people thought the Earth was spherical they were wrong But if you think that thinking the Earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the Earth is flat then your view is wronger than both of them put basic trouble you see is that people think that right and wrong are absolute that everything that perfectly and completely right is totally and equally think so It seems to me that right and wrong are fuzzy concepts and will devote this essay to an explanation of why think my friend the literature expert tells me that in every century scientists think they have worked out the universe and are always wrong what want to know is how wrong are they Are they always wrong to the same degree Isn that what it means to be scientist To push the boundaries of the unknown To bravely actively explore the enormity of our universe Not only is the Universe stranger than we think it is stranger than we can think Said during debate when his opponent asserted that atheism and belief in evolution lead to Atheism by itself is of course not moral position or political one of any kind it simply is the refusal to believe in supernatural dimension For you to say of that it was the implementation of the work of is filthy slander undeserving of you and an insult to this audience thought was not taught in was so derided in along with every other form of unbelief that all the great modern atheists and were alike despised by the National just to take the most notorious of the 20th century totalitarianisms the most finished example the most perfected one the most ruthless and refined one that of National the one that fortunately allowed the escape of all these great atheists thinkers and many others to the United States country of separation of church and state that gave them welcome if it an atheistic regime then how come that in the first chapter of that says that he doing God work and executing God will in destroying the people How come the fuhrer oath that every officer of the Party and the Army had to take making into minor god begins swear in the name of almighty God my loyalty to the Fuhrer You can know the name of bird in all the languages of the world but when finished know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird So look at the bird and see what doing what counts learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing you thought that science was certain well that is just an error on your are in fact two things science and opinion the former begets knowledge the latter develop an instant global consciousness people orientation an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world and compulsion to do something about it From out there on the moon international politics look so petty You want to grab politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him quarter of million miles out and say Look at that you son of is easy to overlook this thought that life just is As humans we are inclined to feel that life must have point We have plans and aspirations and desires We want to take constant advantage of all the intoxicating existence been endowed with But life to lichen Yet its impulse to exist to be is every bit as strong as ours arguably even stronger If were told that had to spend decades being furry growth on rock in the woods believe would lose the will to go on Like virtually all living things they will suffer any hardship endure any insult for additional existence Life in short just wants to is slightly arresting notion that if you were to pick yourself apart with tweezers one atom at time you would produce mound of fine atomic dust none of which had ever been alive but all of which had once been Look pair of boobs Sit down before fact as little child be prepared to give up every preconceived notion follow humbly wherever and to whatever abysses nature leads or you shall learn nothing have only begun to learn content and peace of mind since have resolved at all risks to do role played by time at the beginning of the universe is believe the final key to removing the need for Grand Designer and revealing how the universe created itself Time itself must come to stop You can get to time before the big bang because there was no time before the big bang We have finally found something that does not have cause because there was no time for cause to exist in For me this means there is no possibility of creator because there is no time for creator to have existed Since time itself began at the moment of the Big Bang it was an event that could not have been caused or created by anyone or anything So when people ask me if god created the universe tell them the question itself makes no sense Time didn exist before the Big Bang so there is no time for God to make the universe in It like asking for directions to the edge of the Earth The Earth is sphere It does not have an edge so looking for it is futile talk about dark matter the invisible mysterious substance that occupies the space between stars Dark matter makes up percent of the universe and they know what it is Well do apathy the truth of it pile together everything we know and care about in the universe and it will still be nothing more than tiny speck in the middle of vast black ocean of Who Gives knowledge that the atoms that comprise life on earth the atoms that make up the human body are traceable to the crucibles that cooked light elements into heavy elements in their core under extreme temperatures and pressures These stars the high mass ones among them went unstable in their later years they collapsed and then exploded scattering their enriched guts across the galaxy guts made of carbon nitrogen oxygen and all the fundamental ingredients of life itself These ingredients become part of gas clouds that condense collapse form the next generation of solar systems stars with orbiting planets And those planets now have the ingredients for life itself So that when look up at the night sky and know that yes we are part of this universe we are in this universe but perhaps more important than both of those facts is that the universe is in us When reflect on that fact look up many people feel small cause their small and the universe is big But feel big because my atoms came from those the bee disappeared off the face of the earth man would only have four years left to is way of thinking much more than it is body of instinct that is found in any man is in all men The strength of the emotion may not be so overpowering the barriers against possession not so insurmountable the urge to accomplish the desire less keen With some inhibitions and urges may be neutralized by other tendencies But with every being the primal emotions are there All men have an emotion to kill when they strongly dislike some one they involuntarily wish he was dead have never killed any one but have read some obituary notices with great you cannot answer are usually far better for you than answers you cannot explains the motions of the planets but it cannot explain who sets the planets in cannot reason people out of position that they did not reason themselves having spent more than three years in one residence for the first time in my life got called for jury duty show up on time ready to serve When we get to the voir dire the lawyer says to me see you re an astrophysicist What that If you imagine the years of history compressed into normal earthly day then life begins very early about with the rise of the first simple organisms but then advances no further for the next sixteen hours Not until almost in the evening with the day over has Earth anything to show the universe but restless skin of microbes Then finally the first sea plants appear followed twenty minutes later by the first jellyfish and the enigmatic fauna first seen by in At trilobites swim onto the scene followed more or less immediately by the shapely creatures of the Just before plants begin to pop up on the land Soon after with less than two hours left in the day the first land creatures follow Thanks to ten minutes or so of balmy weather by the Earth is covered in the great carboniferous forests whose residues give us all our coal and the first winged insects are evident Dinosaurs plod onto the scene just before and hold sway for about of an hour At minutes to midnight they vanish and the age of mammals begins Humans emerge one minute and seventeen seconds before midnight The whole of our recorded history on this scale would be no more than few seconds single human lifetime barely an instant Throughout this greatly day continents slide about and bang together at clip that seems positively reckless Mountains rise and melt away ocean basins come and go ice sheets advance and withdraw And throughout the whole about three times every minute somewhere on the planet there is pop of light marking the impact of meteor or one even larger wonder that anything at all can survive in such pummeled and unsettled environment In fact not many things do for time travel is possible where are the tourists from the future Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe the more often and steadily we reflect upon them the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me do not seek or conjecture either of them as if they were veiled obscurities or extravagances beyond the horizon of my vision see them before me and connect them immediately with the consciousness of my existence straight line is not the shortest distance between two my information changes alter my conclusions What do you do sir If you can approach the complexities both its glories and its horrors with an attitude of humble curiosity acknowledging that however deeply you have seen you have only scratched the surface you will find worlds within worlds beauties you could not heretofore imagine and your own mundane preoccupations will shrink to proper size not all that important in the greater scheme of us try to teach generosity and altruism because we are born selfish Let us understand what our own selfish genes are up to because we may then at least have the chance to upset their designs something that no other species has ever aspired to do want to put on the table not why of the members of the National of Sciences reject God want to know why of the National don bounties of space of infinite outwardness were three empty heroics low comedy and pointless is harder to crack prejudice than an lay there and looked up at the night sky and she told me about stars called blue squares and red swirls and told her never heard of them Of course not she said the really important stuff they never tell you You have to imagine it on your cited violation of the First when New schoolteacher asserted that evolution and the Big Bang are not scientific and that ark carried dinosaurs This case is not about the need to separate church and state about the need to separate ignorant scientifically illiterate people from the ranks of surrender to ignorance and call it God has always been premature and it remains premature is the rule Survival is the is fundamental difference between religion which is based on authority and science which is based on observation and reason Science will win because it is curious situation that the sea from which life first arose should now be threatened by the activities of one form of that life But the sea though changed in sinister way will continue to exist the threat is rather to life am going to tell you about is what we teach our physics students in the third or fourth year of graduate school It is my task to convince you not to turn away because you understand it You see my physics students understand it That is because understand it Nobody does have made ceaseless effort not to ridicule not to bewail not to scorn human actions but to understand are stardust brought to life then empowered by the universe to figure itself out and we have only just had once defined fool as person who ignored information because it disagreed with desired nature is written in that great book which ever is before our eyes mean the universe but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which it is written The book is written in mathematical language and the symbols are triangles circles and other geometrical figures without whose help it is impossible to comprehend single word of it without which one wanders in vain through dark is the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and is an pocket of scientific can mass of jelly that you can hold in your palm imagine angels contemplate the meaning of infinity and even question its own place in the cosmos Especially awe inspiring is the fact that any single brain including yours is made up of atoms that were forged in the hearts of countless stars billions of years ago These particles drifted for eons and until gravity and change brought them together here now These atoms now form conglomerate your brain that can not only ponder the very stars that gave it birth but can also think about its own ability to think and wonder about its own ability to wonder With the arrival of humans it has been said the universe has suddenly become conscious of itself This truly it the greatest mystery of lazy afternoon couple lying naked in bed reading to each other and arguing about whether the Galaxy is more numinous than the Do they know how to have good time or they One of the biggest problems with the world today is that we have large groups of people who will accept whatever they hear on the grapevine just because it suits their worldview not because it is actually true or because they have evidence to support it The really striking thing is that it would not take much effort to establish validity in most of these cases but people prefer reassurance to are not contrary to nature but only contrary to what we know about find the universal elements enough to find the air and the water exhilarating to be refreshed by morning walk or an evening saunter to be thrilled by the stars at night to be elated over nest or wildflower in spring these are some of the rewards of the simple life love science and it pains me to think that so many are terrified of the subject or feel that choosing science means you cannot also choose compassion or the arts or be awed by nature Science is not meant to cure us of mystery but to reinvent and reinvigorate is science and as such has no articles of faith accordingly in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically or demonstrated through indubitable is and will ever remain an equation incapable of solution but it contains certain known people in order to discover God read books But there is great book the very appearance of created things Look above you Look below you Read it God whom you want to discover never wrote that book with ink Instead He set before your eyes the things that He had made Can you ask for louder voice than that In chemist named de tested the flammability of hydrogen by gulping mouthful and blowing across an open flame proving at stroke that hydrogen is indeed explosively combustible and that eyebrows are not necessarily permanent feature of protest about bullfighting in the eating of dogs in South or the slaughter of baby seals in while continuing to eat eggs from hens who have spent their lives crammed into cages or veal from calves who have been deprived of their mothers their proper diet and the freedom to lie down with their legs extended is like denouncing apartheid in South while asking your neighbors not to sell their houses to blacks know that the molecules in my body are traceable to phenomena in the cosmos That makes me want to grab people on the street and say Have you HEARD THIS wish someone had just told me the truth right up front as soon as was old enough to understand it wish someone had just said Here the deal You re something called human being That really smart kind of animal Like every other animal on this planet we re descended from organism that lived millions of years ago This happened by process called evolution and you ll learn more about it But trust me that really how we all got here There proof of it everywhere buried in the rocks That story you heard About how we were all created by dude named God who lives up in the sky Total bullshit The whole God thing is actually an ancient fairy tale that people have been telling one another for thousands of years We made it all up Like and the Oh and by the way there no or Also bullshit Sorry kid Deal with when you look at the sky you know you are looking at stars which are hundreds and thousands of away from you And some of the stars don even exist anymore because their light has taken so long to get to us that they are already dead or they have exploded and collapsed into red dwarfs And that makes you seem very small and if you have difficult things in you life it is nice to think that they are what is called negligible which means they are so small you don have to take them into account when you are calculating human spirit must prevail over downside of my celebrity is that cannot go anywhere in the world without being recognized It is not enough for me to wear dark sunglasses and wig The wheelchair gives me is funny that way Sometimes the dumbest thing you do turns out to be the smartest foolish faith in authority is the worst enemy of glorious day in which one seems to be dissolved and absorbed and sent pulsing onward we know not where Life seems neither long nor short and we take no more heed to save time or make haste than do the trees and stars This is true freedom good practical sort of that comes together falls apart Everything The chair sitting on It was built and so it will fall apart gonna fall apart probably before this chair And you re gonna fall apart The cells and organs and systems that make you you they came together grew together and so must fall apart The knew one thing science didn prove for millennia after his death increases Things fall can only see short distance ahead but we can see plenty there that needs to be been suggested that if the really had the powers they claim win the lottery every week prefer to point out that they could also win Prize for discovering fundamental physical forces hitherto unknown to science Either way why are they wasting their talents doing party turns on television By all means be but not so that our brains drop science fragments everything in order to understand it kills everything in order to examine it Jokes of the proper kind properly told can do more to enlighten questions of politics philosophy and literature than any number of dull Earth planet Universe home address as inscribed on the inside front cover of his first field journal Wonder is the seed of am convinced that the act of thinking logically cannot possibly be natural to the human mind If it were then mathematics would be easiest course at school and our species would not have taken several millennia to figure out the scientific may be described as the art of systematic theory appears to you as the only possible one take this as sign that you have neither understood the theory nor the problem which it was intended to is the most important product of creative brain The ultimate purpose is the complete mastery of mind over the material world the harnessing of human nature to human our reasonings concerning matter of fact there are all imaginable degrees of assurance from the highest certainty to the lowest species of moral evidence wise man therefore proportions his belief to the natural to think that living things must be the handiwork of designer But it was also natural to think that the sun went around the earth naive impressions to figure out how things really work is one of highest callings Can You Believe in God and Evolution Time Magazine shall not commit the fashionable stupidity of regarding everything cannot explain as fraud address to the Society for Research in amount of experimentation can ever prove me right single experiment can prove me turned out was pretty good in science But again because of the small budget in science class we afford to do experiments in order to prove theories We just believed everything Actually think that class was called Religion Religion class was always an easy class All you had to do was suspend the logic and reasoning you were being taught in all the other is bit like the joke about the drunk who is looking under lamppost for key that he has lost on the other side of the street because where the light is It has no other got the truth you can demonstrate it Talking prove it What have denied and what my reason compels me to deny is the existence of Being throned above us as god directing our mundane affairs in detail regarding us as individuals punishing us rewarding us as human judges the churches learn to take this rational view of things when they become true schools of ethics and stop teaching fables they will be more effective than they are If they would turn all that ability to teaching this one thing the fact that honesty is best that selfishness and lies of any sort must surely fail to produce happiness they would accomplish actual things Religious faiths and creeds have greatly hampered our development They have absorbed and wasted some fine intellects That creeds are getting to be less and less important to the average mind with every passing year is good sign think although do not wish to talk about what is commonly called criticisms which have been hurled at me have not worried me man cannot control his beliefs If he is honest in his frank expression of them that is all that can in justice be required of him and thousand others do not in the least agree with me His criticism of me as read it charged that because doubted the soul immortality or personality as he called it my mind must be abnormal pathological in other words diseased try to say exactly what honestly believe to be the truth and more than that no man can do honestly believe that creedists have built up mighty structure of inaccuracy based curiously on those fundamental truths which with every honest man must not alone admit but earnestly acclaim have been working on the same lines for many years have tried to go as far as possible toward the bottom of each subject have studied have not reached my conclusions through study of traditions have reached them through the study of hard fact cannot see that unproved theories or sentiment should be permitted to have influence in the building of conviction upon matters so important Science proves its theories or it rejects them have never seen the slightest scientific proof of the religious theories of heaven and hell of future life for individuals or of personal God earnestly believe that am right cannot help believing as do cannot accept as final any theory which is not provable The theories of the theologians cannot be proved Proof proof That is what always have been after that is what my mind requires before it can accept theory as fact Some things are provable some things disprovable some things are doubtful All the problems which perplex us now will soon or late be solved and solved beyond question through scientific investigation The thing which most impresses me about theology is that it does not seem to be investigating It seems to be asserting merely without actual study Moral teaching is the thing we need most in this world and many of these men could be great moral teachers if they would but give their whole time to it and to scientific search for the truth instead of wasting it upon expounding theories of theology which are not in the first place firmly based What we need is search for fundamentals not reiteration of traditions born in days when men knew even less than we do now Magazine interview Sì perché di mille nelle scienze non val per una scintilla di ragione di un solo sì perché le presenti osservazioni spogliano decreti de passati scrittori quali se vedute avrebbono diversamente in the sciences the authority of thousands of opinions is not worth as much as one tiny spark of reason in an individual man Besides the modern observations deprive all former writers of any authority since if they had seen what we see they would have judged as we sometimes believe your relentless analysis of leaves something out which is your feeling for her beyond knowledge or in spite of knowledge often see how you sob over what you destroy how you want to stop and just worship and you do stop and then moment later you are at it again with knife like will you do after you have revealed all there is to know about Truth What ferocity in your quest of it You destroy and you suffer In some strange way am not with you am against you We are destined to hold two truths love you and fight you And you the same We will be stronger for it each of us stronger with our love and our hate When you caricature and nail down and tear apart hate you want to answer you not with weak or stupid poetry but with wonder as strong as your reality want to fight your surgical knife with all the occult and magical forces of the see wire telegraph is kind of very very long cat You pull his tail in New and his head is meowing in Do you understand this And radio operates exactly the same way you send signals here they receive them there The only difference is that there is no you know looks like there was boy It pretty don know why did it insanity maybe Did you ever do something that makes absolutely no sense but you couldn help yourself Wish me good luck please No need to be afraid just aim of science is not to open the door to infinite wisdom but to set limit to infinite what terms should we think of these beings nonhuman yet possessing so very many characteristics How should we treat them Surely we should treat them with the same consideration and kindness as we show to other humans and as we recognize human rights so too should we recognize the rights of the great apes size and age of the Cosmos are beyond ordinary human understanding Lost somewhere between immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home In cosmic perspective most human concerns seem insignificant even petty And yet our species is young and curious and brave and shows much promise In the last few millennia we have made the most astonishing and unexpected discoveries about the Cosmos and our place within it explorations that are exhilarating to consider They remind us that humans have evolved to wonder that understanding is joy that knowledge is prerequisite to survival believe our future depends on how well we know this Cosmos in which we float like mote of dust in the morning you not think that there are things which you cannot understand and yet which are that some people see things that others cannot But there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men eyes because they know or think they know some things which other men have told them it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all and if it explain not then it says there is nothing to the vastness of space and the immensity of time it is my joy to share planet and an epoch with to wife in Cosmos Highly organized research is guaranteed to produce nothing this book has lesson it is that we are awfully lucky to be by we mean every living thing To attain any kind of life in this universe of ours appears to be quite an achievement As humans we are doubly lucky of course We enjoy not only the privilege of existence but also the singular ability to appreciate it and even in multitude of ways to make it better It is talent we have only barely begun to cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature And that is because in the last analysis we ourselves are part of the mystery that we are trying to is hardly unusual Miss The longer live the more come to realize that it is the natural state of the human mind There are many who will strive to defend its sanctity and then expect you to be impressed with their efforts penetrated the outer cell membrane with nanosyringe You poked it with stick No said Well Yes But it was scientific poke with very scientific stick agree with people like that mankind felt the need for creation myths Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that we sought false explanations for them Now science has filled in some of the realm not all that religion used to slowly slides down the glass as if the night is if the open windows of science at first make us shiver after the cozy indoor warmth of traditional humanizing myths in the end the fresh air brings vigor and the great spaces have splendor of their essence of is told us in the Garden of history The fruit that was forbidden was on the tree of knowledge The subtext is All the suffering you have is because you wanted to find out what was going on You could be in the Garden of if you had just kept your fucking mouth shut and asked any apologize for burning too brightly or collapsing into yourself every night That is how galaxies are made new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light but rather because its opponents eventually die and new generation grows up that is familiar with always make people better happier and more helpful they are sunshine food and medicine to the provides us with facts so romantic that imagination itself could add nothing to to diseases make habit of two things to help or at least to do no is often stated that of all the theories proposed in this century the silliest is quantum theory In fact some say that the only thing that quantum theory has going for it is that it is unquestionably terms of doing things take fairly scientific approach to why things happen and how they happen know if god or not This most beautiful system of the sun planets and comets could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being This Being governs all things not as the soul of the world but as over all and on account of his dominion he is wont to be called God παντοκρατωρ or Universal you villains that science Discovery is always rape of the natural world turns out that an eerie type of chaos can lurk just behind facade of order and yet deep inside the chaos lurks an even eerier type of today have forgotten really just part of nature Yet they destroy the nature on which our lives depend They always think they can make something better Especially scientists They may be smart but most understand the heart of nature They only invent things that in the end make people unhappy Yet so proud of their inventions worse most people are too They view them as if they were miracles They worship them They know it but losing nature They see that going to perish The most important things for human beings are clean air and clean what about the End of the Universe miss the big moment seen it rubbish said nothing but gnab gib what Opposite of big bang Come on get all do not attempt to use science mean the real sciences as defence against They will positively encourage him to think about realities he can touch and see May it independence be to the world what believe it will be to some parts sooner to others later but finally to all the signal of arousing men to burst the chains under which monkish ignorance and superstition had persuaded them to bind themselves and to assume the blessings and security of That form which we have substituted restores the free right to the unbounded exercise of reason and freedom of opinion All eyes are opened or opening to the rights of man The general spread of the light of science has already laid open to every view the palpable truth that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs nor favored few booted and spurred ready to ride them legitimately These are grounds of hope for others For ourselves let the annual return of this day forever refresh our recollections of these rights and an undiminished devotion to them Letter to on the anniversary of the signing of the of Independence in This was last letter What is it with science these days Everyone is so quick to believe in it in all these new scientific discoveries new pills for this new pills for that Get thinner grow hair yada yada yada but when it requires little faith in something you all go crazy He shook his head If miracles had chemical equations then everyone would can observe lot just by the invention of the scientific method and science is sure all agree the most powerful intellectual idea the most powerful framework for thinking and investigating and understanding and challenging the world around us that there is and that it rests on the premise that any idea is there to be attacked and if it withstands the attack then it lives to fight another day and if it withstand the attack then down it goes Religion seem to work like that it has certain ideas at the heart of it which we call sacred or holy or whatever an idea so familiar with whether we subscribe to it or not that kind of odd to think what it actually means because really what it means is Here is an idea or notion that not allowed to say anything bad about just not Why not because not We are at the very beginning of time for the human race It is not unreasonable that we grapple with problems But there are tens of thousands of years in the future Our responsibility is to do what we can learn what we can improve the solutions and pass them for what against the story is against those who pervert and misuse religion or any other kind of doctrine with holy book and priesthood and an apparatus of power that wields unchallengeable authority in order to dominate and suppress human chief deficiency see in the skeptical movement is its polarization Us vs Them the sense that we have monopoly on the truth that those other people who believe in all these stupid doctrines are morons that if sensible listen to us and if not to hell with you This is nonconstructive It does not get our message across It condemns us to permanent minority of us saw religion as harmless nonsense Beliefs might lack all supporting evidence but we thought if people needed crutch for consolation the harm 11th changed all rich nations for that is what we are have an obligation not only to the poor nations but to all the grandchildren of the world rich and poor We have not inherited this earth from our parents to do with it what we will We have borrowed it from our children and we must be careful to use it in their interests as well as our own Anyone who fails to recognise the basic validity of the proposition put in different ways by increasing numbers of writers from to The of is either ignorant fool or knew the world would not be the same few people laughed few people cried Most people were silent remembered the line from the scripture the is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his form and says Now am become Death the destroyer of worlds suppose we all thought that one way or it came time for me to give my talk on the subject started off by drawing an outline of the cat and began to name the various other students in the class interrupt me We know all that Oh say you do Then no wonder can catch up with you so fast after had four years of biology They had wasted all their time memorizing stuff like that when it could be looked up in fifteen scientifically investigating the natural world the only thing worse than blind believer is seeing my own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose but queerer than we can suppose have read and heard many attempts at systematic account of it from materialism and theosophy to the system or that of and have always felt that they were much too simple suspect that there are more things in heaven and earth that are dreamed of or can be dreamed of in any philosophy That is the reason why have no philosophy myself and must be my excuse for is the process that takes us from confusion to understanding Nothing exists except atoms and empty space everything else is who are not shocked when they first come across quantum theory cannot possibly have understood patient with him If the same quality did not exist in you you wouldn notice it in greatest blessing granted to mankind come by way of madness which is divine gift competitive advantage will come not from how well its schools teach the multiplication and periodic tables but from how well they stimulate imagination and my boy is made up of mistakes but they are mistakes which it is useful to make because they lead little by little to the is like sex sometimes something useful comes out but that is not the reason we are doing it celibate clergy is an especially good idea because it tends to suppress any hereditary propensity toward intelligent being whether it breathes or not coughs nervously at some time in its our brains were simple enough for us to understand them be so simple that we Suppose that we are wise enough to learn and know and yet not wise enough to control our learning and knowledge so that we use it to destroy ourselves Even if that is so knowledge remains better than ignorance It is better to know even if the knowledge endures only for the moment that comes before destruction than to gain eternal life at the price of dull and swinish lack of comprehension of universe that swirls unseen before us in all its wonder That was the choice of and it is mine want to believe he want to believe he wanted to owe huge debt to for emancipating us all from the stupid belief in an or let alone system He quite literally taught us our place and allowed us to go on to make extraordinary advances in knowledge regard the afterlife to be fairy story for people that are afraid of the only begins at the point where we have come to know that Reason glorified for centuries is the most obstinate adversary of scientific expert that means know nothing about absolutely humble for you are made of earth Be noble for you are made of in my opinion all things in nature occur of the penalties of an ecological education is that one lives alone in world of wounds Much of the damage inflicted on land is quite invisible to laymen An ecologist must either harden his shell and make believe that the consequences of science are none of his business or he must be the doctor who sees the marks of death in community that believes itself well and does not want to be told not become someone else just because you are hurt Be who you are smile it may solve all problems you have feeling of awed wonder that science can give us is one of the highest experiences of which the human psyche is capable It is deep aesthetic passion to rank with the finest that music and poetry can deliver It is truly one of the things that make life worth living and it does so if anything more effectively if it convinces us that the time we have for living is quite so hard to believe in anything anymore mean like religion you really take it seriously because it seems so mythological it seems so arbitrary but on the other hand science is just pure empiricism and by virtue of its method it excludes metaphysics guess believe in anything anymore if it for my lucky astrology mood sciences are vain and full of errors that are not born of Experience the mother of all are all star feel that even if all possible scientific questions be answered the problems of life have still not been touched at human misery is more often caused not so much by stupidity as by ignorance particularly our ignorance about are survival machines robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes This is truth which still fills me with Without his Alchemy just little brat who swears An arrogant Useless Just Sorry big brother know how to add to that Ed starts to cry ALL ON ME the whole problem with science got bunch of empiricists trying to describe things of unimaginable cannot be accounted for in physical terms For consciousness is absolutely fundamental It cannot be accounted for in terms of anything may live to see horrors beyond your know wrong with scientific power form of inherited wealth And you know what assholes congenitally rich people has become almost cliché to remark that nobody boasts of ignorance of literature but it is socially acceptable to boast ignorance of science and proudly claim incompetence in mathematics blade of grass is commonplace on Earth it would be miracle on Our descendants on will know the value of patch of green And if blade of grass is priceless what is the value of human being Philosophy of science is about as useful to scientists as ornithology is to is world of nuclear giants and ethical infants We know more about war than we know about peace more about killing than we know about living We have grasped the mystery of the atom and rejected the Sermon on the understand more than we is what we understand well enough to explain to computer art is everything else remember discussions with which went through many hours till very late at night and ended almost in despair and when at the end of the discussion went alone for walk in the neighbouring park repeated to myself again and again the question Can nature possibly be so absurd as it seemed to us in these atomic experiments The invisible and the look very much real purpose of the scientific method is to make sure nature hasn misled you into thinking you know something you actually don Universe is not only queerer than we suppose but queerer than we can more clearly we can focus our attention on the wonders and realities of the universe about us the less taste we shall have for the destruction of our race Wonder and humility are wholesome emotions and they do not exist side by side with lust for destruction Speech accepting the Now no scientist but know what endorphins are tiny little magical elves that swim through your blood stream and tell funny jokes to each other When they reach your brain you hear what saying and that boosts your health and happiness Knock Knock There Little endorphin Little endorphin who Little Endorphin And then the endorphins laugh and then you laugh See Its one ever said that you would live to see the repercussions of everything you do or that you have guarantees or that you are not obliged to wander in the dark or that everything will be proved to you and neatly verified like something in science Nothing is at least nothing that is worthwhile bring you up only to move across sure ground teach you to think that everything must be within our control or understanding Did For if did was wrong fyou take chance then the powers you refuse because you cannot explain them will as they say make monkey out of conversation with about the Water was boring and riddled with technical details So paraphrase for you Me This is obviously clog How about take it apart and check the internal tubing After about hours of deliberation No fuck it up and die So took it apart When asked why are numbers beautiful It like asking why is van Symphony beautiful If you see why someone tell you know numbers are beautiful If they beautiful nothing we all know blinking lights means seem to me that this fantastically marvelous universe this tremendous range of time and space and different kinds of animals and all the different planets and all these atoms with all their motions and so on all this complicated thing can merely be stage so that God can watch human beings struggle for good and evil which is the view that religion has The stage is too big for the could give tutorial And you could thrill him to the core of his being was an encyclopedic polymath an all time intellect Yet not only can you know more than him about the world You also can have deeper understanding of how everything works Such is the privilege of living after and their colleagues not saying more intelligent than or wiser For all know the cleverest person who ever lived not the point The point is only that science is cumulative and we live with his five senses man explores the universe around him and calls the adventure this distant vantage point the Earth might not seem of particular interest But for us different Consider again that dot here home us On it everyone you love everyone you know everyone you ever heard of every human being who ever was lived out their lives The aggregate of our joy and suffering thousands of confident religions ideologies and economic doctrines every hunter and forager every hero and coward every creator and destroyer of civilization every king and peasant every

history of our species lived there on mote of dust suspended in Earth is very small stage in vast cosmic arena Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of fraction of dot Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner how frequent their misunderstandings how eager they are to kill one another how fervent their hatreds Our posturings our imagined the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe are challenged by this point of pale light Our planet is lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark In our obscurity in all this vastness there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life There is nowhere else at least in the near future to which our species could migrate Visit yes Settle not yet Like it or not for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand It has been said that astronomy is humbling and experience There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world To me it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot the only home ever is always discovering odd scraps of magical wisdom and making tremendous fuss about its are star stuff harvesting very real sense we have two minds one that thinks and one that are star stuff which has taken its destiny into its own asked about which scientist like to meet said No question about it The smartest person ever to walk the face of this earth The man was connected to the universe in

we are what makes us individual our life force our suggests an experiment Look back again at the pale blue dot of the preceding chapter Take good long look at it at the dot for any length of time and then try to convince yourself that God created the whole Universe for one of the million or so species of life that inhabit that speck of dust Now take it step further Imagine that everything was made just for single shade of that species or gender or ethnic or religious subdivision If this doesn strike you as unlikely pick another dot Imagine it to be inhabited by different form of intelligent life They too cherish the notion of God who has created everything for their benefit How seriously do you take their claim And new philosophy emerged called quantum physics which suggest that the individual function is to inform and be informed You really exist only when you re in field sharing and exchanging information You create the realities you general law leading to the advancement of all organic beings namely multiply vary let the strongest live and the weakest we long for our planet to be important there is something we can do about it We make our world significant by the courage of our questions and by the depth of our answers But own that cannot see as plainly as others do and as should wish to do evidence of design and beneficence on all sides of us There seems to me too much misery in the world cannot persuade myself that beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created the with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of or that cat should play with mice feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect dog might as well speculate on the mind of Let each man hope and believe what he and laws lay hid in night God said Let be and all was light am too much of skeptic to deny the possibility of are friendly atheistic lot whose minds are preoccupied with sex chess and baseball when they are not preoccupied with science believe that the universe was formed around billion years ago and that humans have evolved from their apelike ancestors over the past few million years believe we are more likely to live good life if all humans try to work together in world community preserving planet earth When decisions for groups are made in this world believe that the democratic process should be used To protect the individual believe in freedom of speech freedom of the press freedom of religion freedom from religion freedom of inquiry and wall of separation between church and state When making decisions about what is right or wrong believe should use my intelligence to reason about the likely consequences of my actions believe that should try to increase the happiness of everyone by caring for other people and finding ways to cooperate Never should my actions discriminate against people simply because of their race religion sex sexual orientation age or national origin believe that ideas about what is right and wrong will change with education so am prepared to continually question ideas using evidence from experience and science believe there is no valid evidence to support claims for the existence of supernatural entities and deities will use these beliefs to guide my thinking and my actions until find good reasons for revising them or replacing them with other beliefs that are more man of science has learned to believe in justification not by faith but by to say jamming deformed drugged overstressed birds together in filthy room is not very healthy Beyond deformities eye damage blindness bacterial infections of bones slipped vertebrae paralysis internal bleeding anemia slipped tendons twisted lower legs and necks respiratory diseases and weakened immune systems are frequent and problems on factory if humanity is the last war then am the night before brain surgery thought about death searched out my larger values and asked myself if was going to die did want to do it fighting and clawing or in peaceful surrender What sort of character did hope to show Was content with myself and what had done with my life so far decided that was essentially good person although could have been at the same time understood that the cancer care asked myself what believed had never prayed lot hoped hard wished hard but pray had developed certain distrust of organized religion growing up but felt had the capacity to be spiritual person and to hold some fervent beliefs Quite simply believed had responsibility to be good person and that meant fair honest hardworking and honorable If did that if was good to my family true to my friends if gave back to my community or to some cause if liar cheat or thief then believed that should be enough At the end of the day if there was indeed some Body or presence standing there to judge me hoped would be judged on whether had lived true life not on whether believed in certain book or whether been baptized If there was indeed God at the end of my days hoped he say But you were never so going the other way from heaven If so was going to reply You know what right Fine believed too in the doctors and the medicine and the believed in that believed in them person like his oncologist someone to believe in thought person with the mind to develop an experimental treatment years ago that now could save my life believed in the hard currency of his intelligence and his that had no idea where to draw the line between spiritual belief and science But knew this much believed in belief for its own shining sake To believe in the face of utter hopelessness every article of evidence to the contrary to ignore apparent other choice was there We do it every day realized We are so much stronger than we imagine and belief is one of the most valiant and human characteristics To believe when all along we humans know that nothing can cure the briefness of this life that there is no remedy for our basic mortality that is form of continue believing in yourself believing in the doctors believing in the treatment believing in whatever chose to believe in that was the most important thing decided It had to belief we would be left with nothing but an overwhelming doom every single day And it will beat you fully see until the cancer how we fight every day against the creeping negatives of the world how we struggle daily against the slow lapping of cynicism and disappointment these were the real perils of life not some sudden illness or cataclysmic millennium doomsday knew now why people fear cancer because it is slow and inevitable death it is the very definition of cynicism and loss of there between our legs like an entertainment complex in the middle of sewage system Who designed that It is very expensive to give bad medical care to poor people in rich country think imagination is at the heart of everything we do Scientific discoveries have happened without imagination Art music and literature exist without imagination And so anything that strengthens imagination and reading certainly does that can help us for the rest of our exists indeed an opposition to it building of secular college by the friends of and which is not strong The most restive is that of the priests of the different religious sects who dread the advance of science as witches do the approach of and scowl on it the fatal harbinger announcing the subversion of the duperies on which they live In this the Presbyterian clergy take the lead The tocsin is sounded in all their pulpits and the first alarm denounced is against the particular creed of and as impudently denounced as if they really knew what it is Letter to Da Not single one of the cells that compose you knows who you are or and science have learned are two sides of the same coin separated by an expanse so small but wide enough that one side see the other They know they are idea that God is an oversized white male with flowing beard who sits in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous But if by God one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe then clearly there is such God This God is emotionally unsatisfying it does not make much sense to pray to the law of is nothing which can better deserve our patronage than the promotion of science and literature Knowledge is in every country the surest basis of public scientist does not study nature because it is useful to do so He studies it because he takes pleasure in it and he takes pleasure in it because it is beautiful If nature were not beautiful it would not be worth knowing and life would not be worth living am not speaking of course of the beauty which strikes the senses of the beauty of qualities and appearances am far from despising this but it has nothing to do with science What mean is that more intimate beauty which comes from the harmonious order of its parts and which pure intelligence can it is best to keep an open mind and be agnostic At first sight that seems an unassailable position at least in the weak sense of wager But on second thoughts it seems because the same could be said of Father and tooth fairies There may be fairies at the bottom of the garden There is no evidence for it but you prove that there any so we be agnostic with respect to fairies believe in intuition and inspiration Imagination is more important than knowledge For knowledge is limited whereas imagination embraces the entire world stimulating progress giving birth to evolution It is strictly speaking real factor in scientific matter how beautiful your theory is it matter how smart you are If it agree with experiment repeats but science along the lines which the theologies have mapped will never lead us to discovery of the fundamental facts of our existence That goal must be attained by means of exact science and can only be achieved by such means The fact that man for ages has superstitiously believed in what he calls God does not prove at all that his theory has been right There have been many gods all makeshifts born of inability to fathom the deep fundamental truth There must be something at the bottom of existence and man in ignorance being unable to discover what it is through reason because his reason has been so imperfect undeveloped has used instead imagination and created figments of one kind or another which according to the country he was born in the suggestions of his environment satisfied him for the time being Not one of all the gods of all the various theologies has ever really been proved We accept no ordinary scientific fact without the final proof why should we then be satisfied in this most mighty of all matters with mere theory Destruction of false theories will not decrease the sum of human happiness in future any more than it has in the past The days of miracles have passed do not believe of course that there was ever any day of actual miracles cannot understand that there were ever any miracles at all My guide must be my reason and at thought of miracles my reason is rebellious Personally do not believe that laid claim to doing miracles or asserted that he had miraculous power Our intelligence is the aggregate intelligence of the cells which make us up There is no soul distinct from mind and what we speak of as the mind is just the aggregate intelligence of cells It is fallacious to declare that we have souls apart from animal intelligence apart from brains It is the brain that keeps us going There is nothing beyond goes on endlessly but no more in human beings than in other animals or for that matter than in vegetables Life collectively must be immortal human beings individually cannot be as see it for they are not the individuals they are mere aggregates of is no supernatural We are continually learning new things There are powers within us which have not yet been developed and they will develop We shall learn

the bright sun was and the wander darkling in the eternal these boys in their right minds Here were two boys with good intellect one eighteen and one nineteen They had all the prospects that life could hold out for any of the young one graduate of and another of one who had passed his examination for the Law School and was about to take trip in another who had passed at the youngest in his class with three thousand dollars in the bank Boys who never knew what it was to want dollar boys who could reach any position that was to boys of that kind to reach boys of distinguished and honorable families families of wealth and position with all the world before them And they gave it all up for nothing for nothing They took little companion of one of them on crowded street and killed him for nothing and sacrificed everything that could be of value in human life upon the crazy scheme of couple of immature your Honor you have been boy have been boy And we have known other boys The best way to understand somebody else is to put yourself in his it within the realm of your imagination that boy who was right with all the prospects of life before him who could choose what he wanted without the slightest reason in the world would lure young companion to his death and take his place in the shadow of the gallows No one who has the process of reasoning could doubt that boy who would do that is not insane they are care not whether medically or legally They did not reason they could not reason they committed the most foolish most unprovoked most purposeless most causeless act that any two boys ever committed and they put themselves where the rope is dangling above their heads Why did they kill little Not for money not for spite not for hate They killed him as they might kill spider or fly for the experience They killed him because they were made that way Because somewhere in the infinite processes that go to the making up of the boy or the man something slipped and those unfortunate lads sit here hated despised outcasts with the community shouting for their blood know Your Honor that every atom of life in all this universe is bound up together know that pebble cannot be thrown into the ocean without disturbing every drop of water in the sea know that every life is inextricably mixed and woven with every other life know that every influence conscious and unconscious acts and reacts on every living organism and that no one can fix the blame know that all life is series of infinite chances which sometimes result one way and sometimes another have not the infinite wisdom that can fathom it neither has any other human effort to understand the universe is one of the very few things that lifts human life little above the level of farce and gives it

proposition seems to me in high degree probable namely that any animal whatever endowed with social instincts the parental and filial affections being here included would inevitably acquire moral sense or conscience as soon as its intellectual powers had become as well or nearly as well developed as in man For firstly the social instincts lead an animal to take pleasure in the society of its fellows to feel certain amount of sympathy with them and to perform various services for can allow satellites planets suns universe nay whole systems of universe to be governed by laws but the

not happy you really surprised by the endurance of religion What ideology is likely to be more durable than one that conforms at every turn to our powers of wishful thinking Hope is easy knowledge is hard Science is the one domain in which we human beings make truly heroic effort to counter our innate biases and wishful thinking Science is the one endeavor in which we have developed refined methodology for separating what person hopes is true from what he has good reason to believe The methodology perfect and the history of science is riddled with abject failures of scientific objectivity But that is just the have been failures of science discovered and corrected religion No by good was the general opinion of ancient nations that the divinity alone was adequate to the important office of giving laws to men and modern nations in the consecrations of kings and in several superstitious chimeras of divine rights in princes and nobles are nearly unanimous in preserving remnants of it Is the jealousy of power and the envy of superiority so strong in all men that no considerations of public or private utility are sufficient to engage their submission to rules for their own happiness Or is the disposition to imposture so prevalent in men of experience that their private views of ambition and avarice can be accomplished only by artifice There is nothing in which mankind have been more unanimous yet nothing can be inferred from it more than this that the multitude have always been credulous and the few artful The United States of have exhibited perhaps the first example of governments erected on the simple principles of nature and if men are now sufficiently enlightened to disabuse themselves of artifice imposture hypocrisy and superstition they will consider this event as an era in their history Although the detail of the formation of the governments is at present little known or regarded either in or it may hereafter become an object of curiosity It will never be pretended that any persons employed in that service had any interviews with the gods or were in any degree under the inspiration of heaven any more than those at work upon ships or houses or labouring in merchandize or agriculture it will for ever be acknowledged that these governments were contrived merely by the use of reason and the senses As painted and and as and

and never will end The human being is no exception to the natural order Man like the universe is machine Nothing enters our minds or determines our actions which is not directly or indirectly response to stimuli beating upon our sense organs from without Owing to the similarity of our construction and the sameness of our environment we respond in like manner to similar stimuli and from the concordance of our reactions understanding is born In the course of ages mechanisms of infinite complexity are developed but what we call soul or spirit is nothing more than the sum of the functionings of the body When this functioning ceases the soul or the spirit ceases likewise expressed these ideas long before the behaviorists led by in and by in the United States proclaimed their new psychology This apparently mechanistic conception is not antagonistic to an ethical conception of mechanics describes nature as absurd from the point of view of common sense And yet it fully agrees with experiment So hope you can accept nature as She is God we trust All others must have data the most civilized countries of the world spend maximum of their income on war and minimum on education The century will reverse this order It will be more glorious to fight against ignorance than to die on the field of battle The discovery of new scientific truth will be more important than the squabbles of diplomats Even the newspapers of our own day are beginning to treat scientific discoveries and the creation of fresh philosophical concepts as news The newspapers of the century will give mere stick in the back pages to accounts of crime or political controversies but will headline on the front pages the proclamation of new scientific along such lines will be impossible while

states that something is possible he is almost certainly right When he states that something is impossible he is very probably is based on experiment on willingness to challenge old dogma on an openness to see the universe as it really is Accordingly science sometimes requires courage at the very least the courage to question the conventional wisdom الكيمياء والطبيعة والكهرباء هي العلوم

أن نجعل من الكهرباء وسيلة إضاءة لا وسيلة للهلاك If we wish to draw philosophical conclusions about our own existence our significance and the significance of the universe itself our conclusions should be based on empirical knowledge truly open mind means forcing our imaginations to conform to the evidence of reality and not vice versa whether or not we like the implications من أوجب الواجبات على

ضاع استقلال العلم ضاع العلم وضاعت الفضيلة بل وضاعت الأمة وقد بقيت أوروبا ألف عام في ظلمات العصور الوسطى لأن أمورهم كانت في أيدي قوم لا يؤمنون بالحق ولا يؤمنون باستقلال العلم فاضطهدوا العلماء وحاربوا

because small and tenuous species arising in quarter of million years ago has managed so far to survive by hook and by crook We may yearn for higher answer but none my antagonist said Is it impossible that there are flying saucers Can you prove that impossible No said prove impossible just very unlikely At that he said You are very unscientific If you prove it impossible then how can you say that unlikely But that is the way that is scientific It is scientific only to say what is more likely and what less likely and not to be proving all the time the possible and absolutely sure of its infallibility is teaches to think but love teaches to truth of our faith becomes matter of ridicule among the infidels if any not gifted with the necessary scientific learning presents as dogma what scientific scrutiny shows to be false When distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible he is almost certainly right When he states that something is impossible he is very probably wrong The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture little way past them into the impossible Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic إن

unaccountable became tired and sick Till rising and gliding out wander off by myself In the mystical moist and from time to time Look up in perfect silence at the long as the universe had beginning we could suppose it had creator But if the universe is really completely having no boundary or edge it would have neither beginning nor end it would simply be What place then for creator One of the strongest motives that lead men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness from the fetters of own desires finely tempered nature longs to escape from the personal life into the world of objective perception and recently have learned from discussions with variety of scientists and other the scientists participating with me in the workshop on the future of naturalism that they lean the other way free will in their view is obviously incompatible with naturalism with determinism and very likely incoherent against any background so they cheerfully insist that of course they have free will couldn have free will but so what It has nothing to do with morality or the meaning of life Their advice to me at the symposium was simple recast my pressing question as whether naturalism materialism determinism science has any implications for what we may call moral competence For instance does neuroscience show that we cannot be responsible for our choices cannot justifiably be praised or blamed rewarded or punished Abandon the term free will to the libertarians and other incompatibilists who can pursue their fantasies untroubled Note that this is not dismissal of the important issues it proposal about which camp gets to use and define the term am beginning to appreciate the benefits of discarding the term free will altogether but that course too involves lot of heavy lifting if one is to avoid being everything that distinguishes the modern world from earlier centuries is attibutable to science which achieved its most spectacular triumphs in the seventeenth is not the possession of truth but the success which attends the seeking after it that enriches the seeker and brings happiness to although have seen nothing but black crows in my life it mean that no such thing as white crow Both for philosopher and for scientist it can be important not to reject the possibility of finding white crow You might almost say that hunting for the white crow is principal my socks are like snowflakes no two are exactly it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous successive slight modifications my theory would absolutely break down But can find no such real question is not whether machines think but whether men do The mystery which surrounds thinking machine already surrounds thinking one will protect what they care about and no one will care about what they have never aim of science is to discover and illuminate truth And that take it is the aim of literature whether biography or history It seems to me then that there can be no separate literature of science dark matter The universe inside of me is full of something and science even shine light on it feel like mostly made of dream is to dream existing in the universe is the fruit of chance and of reality being passively recorded by the brain it is actively constructed by worship sacred

together by invisible chemical bonds and found strange inexplicable comfort in knowing that somewhere even though we see it in our own world there was real scientist who mutters sadly The experiment is failure we have failed to achieve what we had hoped for is suffering mainly from bad script writer An experiment is never failure solely because it fails to achieve predicted results An experiment is failure only when it also fails adequately to test the hypothesis in question when the data it produces prove anything one way or Gods Or Kings Only Man saw that science had become as great hoax as

power which directly influences the man could if he were so inclined be the sculptor of his own much easier on the emotions when one sees life as an experiment rather than struggle for universe is so unhuman that is it goes its way with so little thought of man He is but an incident not an end We must adjust our notions to the discovery that things are not shaped to him but that he is shaped to them The air was not made for his lungs but he has lungs because there is air the light was not created for his eye but he has eyes because there is light All the forces of nature are going their own

see But microscopes are an whole value of solitude depends upon oneself it may be sanctuary or prison haven of repose or place of punishment heaven or hell as we ourselves make it believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted person who has been punished is not thereby simply less inclined to behave in given way at best he learns how to avoid what greater might do we possess as human beings than our capacity to question and to learn think that modern physics has definitely decided in favor of In fact the smallest units of matter are not physical objects in the ordinary sense they are forms ideas which can be expressed unambiguously only in mathematical may bring upon themselves unnecessary travail by taking tactless and unjustifiable position about the relation between scientific and religious narratives We see this of course in the conflict concerning creation science Some educators representing as they think the conscience of science act much like those legislators who in prohibited by law the teaching of evolution in In that case were fearful that scientific idea would undermine religious belief Today are fearful that religious idea will undermine scientific belief The former had insufficient confidence in religion the latter insufficient confidence in science The point is that profound but contradictory ideas may exist side by side if they are constructed from different materials and methods and have different purposes Each tells us something important about where we stand in the universe and it is foolish to insist that they must despise each we call rational grounds for our beliefs are often extremely irrational attempts to justify our neither cares nor knows just is And we dance to its music hundred years from now people will look back on us and laugh say You know what people used to believe They believed in photons and electrons Can you imagine anything so silly have good laugh because by then there will be newer better fantasies And meanwhile you feel the way the boat moves the sea real You smell the salt in the air You feel the sunlight on your skin all real Life is wonderful gift to be alive to see the sun and breathe the air And there really anything tells me God must mind tells me never understand heart tells me not meant to Science is the ultimate pornography analytic activity whose main aim is to isolate objects or events from their contexts in time and space This obsession with the specific activity of quantified functions is what science shares with pornography wealth of information creates poverty of attention We absolutely must leave room for doubt or there is no progress and there is no learning There is no learning without having to pose question And question requires doubt People search for certainty But there is no certainty People are terrified how can you live and not know It is not odd at all You only think you know as matter of fact And most of your actions are based on incomplete knowledge and you really know what it is all about or what the purpose of the world is or know great deal of other things It is possible to live and not way to find out about our place in the universe is by examining the universe and by examining ourselves without preconceptions with as unbiased mind as we can problem is or rather one of the problems for there are many sizeable proportion of which are continually clogging up the civil commercial and criminal courts in all areas of the Galaxy and especially where possible the more corrupt ones previous sentence makes sense That is not the is it through again and get it When religious couple wrote to about fulfilled prophecies he wrote back in May If fulfilled prophecy is your criterion why do you not believe in materialistic science which has an unparalleled record of fulfilled prophecy Consider for example we turn our backs on science because it is perceived as threat to God abandoning all the promise of advancing our understanding of nature and applying that to the alleviation of suffering and the betterment of humankind will we turn our backs on faith concluding that science has rendered the spiritual life no longer necessary and that traditional religious symbols can now be replaced by engravings of the double helix on our alters Both of these choices are profoundly dangerous Both deny truth Both will diminish the nobility of humankind Both will be devastating to our future And both are unnecessary The God of the Bible is also the God of the genome He can be worshipped in the cathedral or in the laboratory His creation is majestic awesome intricate and beautiful and it cannot be at war with itself Only we imperfect humans can start such battles And only we can end was badly received by the generation to which it was first addressed and the outpouring of angry nonsense to which it gave rise is sad to think upon But the present generation will probably behave just as badly if another should arise and inflict upon them that which the generality of mankind most hate the necessity of revising their convictions Let them then be charitable to us ancients and if they behave no better than the men of my day to some new benefactor let them recollect that after all our wrath did not come to much and vented itself chiefly in the bad language of sanctimonious scolds Let them as speedily perform strategic and follow the truth wherever it who are enslaved to their sects are not merely devoid of all sound knowledge but they will not even stop to learn In the world of the very small where particle and wave aspects of reality are equally significant things do not behave in any way that we can understand from our experience of the everyday world all pictures are false and there is no physical analogy we can make to understand what goes on inside atoms Atoms behave like atoms nothing The is secret for greater the science points to one thing the power of paying meaning of world is the separation of wish and is observing truth in the light of head Religion is observing truth in the light of heart Humanity is using both the lights And education is developing that view is that if your philosophy is not unsettled daily then you are blind to all the universe has to most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder is as good as dead and his eyes are dimmed Science is what you know philosophy is what you aspect of Nature reveals deep mystery and touches our sense of wonder and awe Those afraid of the universe as it really is those who pretend to nonexistent knowledge and envision Cosmos centered on human beings will prefer the fleeting comforts of superstition They avoid rather than confront the world But those with the courage to explore the weave and structure of the Cosmos even where it differs profoundly from their wishes and prejudices will penetrate its deepest mysteries believe in evidence believe in observation measurement and reasoning confirmed by independent observers believe anything no matter how wild and ridiculous if there is evidence for it The wilder and more ridiculous something is however the firmer and more solid the evidence will have to today our very survival depends on our ability to stay awake to adjust to new ideas to remain vigilant and to face the challenge of change The large house in which we live demands that we transform this neighborhood into world wide brotherhood Together we must learn to live as brothers or together we will be forced to perish as must work passionately and indefatigably to bridge the gulf between our scientific progress and our moral progress One of the great problems of mankind is that we suffer from poverty of the spirit which stands in glaring contrast to our scientific and technological abundance The richer we have become materially the poorer we have become morally and are biology We are reminded of this at the beginning and the end at birth and at death In between we do what we can to easiest way to do anything is known is finite the unknown infinite intellectually we stand on an islet in the midst of an illimitable ocean of inexplicability Our business in every generation is to reclaim little more land to add something to the extent and the solidity of our possessions And even cursory glance at the history of the biological sciences during the last quarter of century is sufficient to justify the assertion that the most potent instrument for the extension of the realm of natural knowledge which has come into hands since the publication of is Origin of deeply hidden had to be behind not creepy at all Being in spaceship twelve from home and having someone knock on the door is totally glory of science is that it is freeing the soul breaking the mental manacles getting the brain out of bondage giving courage to thought filling the world with mercy justice and is

the mammals would evolve frontal lobes and complex thought to accompany them We call them primates single branch of these primates would develop genetic mutation that allowed speech and that branch Sapiens would invent agriculture and civilization and philosophy and art and science All in the last ten thousand years Ultimately one of its scientists would invent relativity out of his head and

train yourself to be good centuries the church has stood by while science picked away at religion bit by bit miracles Training the mind to overcome the heart religion as the opiate of the masses They denounce God as hallucination delusional crutch for those too weak to accept that life is meaningless could not stand by while science presumed to harness the power of God himself Proof you say Yes proof of ignorance What is wrong with the admission that something exists beyond our understanding The day science substantiates God in lab is the day people stop needing faith As cities grow and technology takes over the world belief and imagination fade away and so do great advance in science has issued from new audacity of imagination It is not my intention to be fulsome but confess that

quantum mechanics were correct then the world would be crazy was right the world is crazy esteem myself happy to have as great an ally as you in my search for truth will read your work all the more willingly because have for many years been partisan of the view because it reveals to me the causes of many natural phenomena that are entirely incomprehensible in the light of the generally accepted

condemned by countless people for very great is the number of the stupid Letter to fellow revolutionary astronomer The labours of men of genius however erroneously directed scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of and science have not always been friendly toward the idea of God the reason being they are dedicated to the task of accounting for things and are impatient

into chimpanzee and care not who writes the laws we see that science is eminently perfectible and that each theory has constantly to give way to fresh is always coveted most and needed most urgently where will is lacking for will as the affect of command is the decisive sign of sovereignty and strength In other words the less one knows how to command the more urgently one covets someone who commands who commands severely god prince class physician father confessor dogma or party conscience From this one might perhaps gather that the two world religions and may have owed their origin and above all their sudden spread to tremendous collapse and disease of the will And that is what actually happened both religions encountered situation in which the will had become diseased giving rise to demand that had become utterly desperate for some thou shalt Both religions taught fanaticism in ages in which the will had become exhausted and thus they offered innumerable people some support new possibility of willing some delight in willing For fanaticism is the only strength of the will that even the weak and insecure can be brought to attain being sort of hypnotism of the whole system of the senses and the intellect for the benefit of an excessive nourishment hypertrophy of single point of view and feeling that henceforth becomes dominant which the calls his faith Once human being reaches the fundamental conviction that he must be commanded he becomes believer one could conceive of such pleasure and power of such freedom of the will This conception of freedom of the will alias autonomy does not involve any belief in what called the superstition of free will in section alias the exemption of human actions from an otherwise universal determinism that the spirit would take leave of all faith and every wish for certainty being practiced in maintaining himself on insubstantial ropes and possibilities and dancing even near abysses Such spirit would be the free spirit par

here is the point about myself and my Our belief is not belief Our principles are not faith We do not rely solely upon science and reason because these are necessary rather than sufficient factors but we distrust anything that contradicts science or outrages reason We may differ on many things but what we respect is free inquiry openmindedness and the pursuit of ideas for their own are no forbidden questions in science no matters too sensitive or delicate to be probed no sacred it so happens that everything on this planet is ultimately irrational there is not and cannot be any reason for the causal connexion of things if only because our use of the word reason already implies the idea of causal connexion But even if we avoid this fundamental difficulty said that causal connexion was not merely unprovable but unthinkable and in shallower waters still one cannot assign true reason why water should flow down hill or sugar taste sweet in the mouth Attempts to explain these simple matters always progress into learned lucidity and on further analysis retire to remote stronghold where every thing is irrational and you cut off head he dies Why Because it kills him That is really the whole answer Learned excursions into anatomy and physiology only beg the question it does not explain why the heart is necessary to life to say that it is vital organ Yet that is exactly what is done the trick that is played on every inquiring mind Why cannot see in the dark Because light is necessary to sight No confusion of that issue by talk of rods and cones and optical centres and foci and lenses and vibrations is very different to treatment of the is really confined to experience The laws of Nature are as said the laws of our minds and as said the generalization of observed is therefore no

measure of greatness in scientific idea is the extent to which it stimulates thought and opens up new lines of best way to avoid abuses is for the populace in general to be scientifically literate to understand the implications of such investigations In exchange for freedom of inquiry scientists are obliged to explain their work If science is considered closed priesthood too difficult and arcane for the average person to understand the dangers of abuse are greater But if science is topic of general interest and concern if both its delights and its social consequences are discussed regularly and competently in the schools the press and at the dinner table we have greatly improved our prospects for learning how the world really is and for improving both it and only have you been lucky

stronger than seemingly invincible material was reality in the universe when led the children of out of the land of This is true of all natural laws they have always existed but only when understood may they be for practical reasons and for mathematically verifiable moral reasons authority and responsibility must be equal else balancing takes place as surely as current flows between points of unequal potential To permit irresponsible authority is to sow disaster to hold man responsible for anything he does not control is to behave with blind idiocy The unlimited democracies were unstable because their citizens were not responsible for the fashion in which they exerted their sovereign authority other than through the tragic logic of history No attempt was made to determine whether voter was socially responsible to the extent of his literally unlimited authority If he voted the impossible the disastrous possible happened instead and responsibility was then forced on him and destroyed both him and his foundationless temple think the discomfort that some people feel in going to the monkey cages at the zoo is warning mysteries about how we evolved should not distract us from the indisputable fact that we did the scientist sees everything that happens in one point of space the poet feels everything that happens in one point of that was required to measure the planet was man with stick and brain In other words couple an intellect with some experimental apparatus and almost anything seems achievable really like reading will clip an wings Conquer all mysteries by rule and line Empty the haunted air and gnomèd mine rainbow as it erewhile melt into we must not forget that all things in the world are connected with one another and depend on one another and that we ourselves and all our thoughts are also part of nature It is utterly beyond our power to measure the changes of things by time Quite the contrary time is an abstraction at which we arrive by means of the change of things made because we are not restricted to any one definite measure all being interconnected motion is termed uniform in which equal increments of space described correspond to equal increments of space described by some motion with which we form comparison as the rotation of the earth motion may with respect to another motion be uniform But the question whether motion is in itself uniform is senseless With just as little justice also may we speak of an absolute in the face of overwhelming odds left with only one option going to have to science the shit out of makes people kill each other Science supplies them with are no gods no nations no money and no human rights except in our collective is all about proving theories and understanding the universe Science folds everything into neat logical packages The fey are magical capricious illogical and unexplainable Science cannot prove the existence of faeries so naturally we do not exist That type of nonbelief is fatal to become norms and norms become extinct Monster by monster evolution are many sources of spirituality religion may be the most common but it is by no means the only Anything that generates sense of awe may be source of spirituality Science does this in this is where all the vapid talk about the soul of the universe is actually headed Once the principles of reason and science have been discredited the world will not pass into the hands of credulous herbivores who keep crystals by their sides and swoon over the poems of The vacuum will be invaded instead by determined fundamentalists of every stripe who already know the truth by means of revelation and who actually seek real and serious power in the here and now One thinks of the painstaking labor of scientists from to to to to

metaphor of ought to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its antecedent state and as the cause of the state that is to follow An intelligence knowing all the forces acting in nature at given instant as well as the momentary positions of all things in the universe would be able to comprehend in one single formula the motions of the largest bodies as well as the lightest atoms in the world provided that its intellect were sufficiently powerful to subject all data to analysis to it nothing would be uncertain the future as well as the past would be present to its eyes

been accepting Philosophy wisdom sagesse is the quite personal affair It mustarise as His wisdom as his knowledge tendingtoward universality knowledge for which he can answer fromthe beginning and at each step by virtue of his own my experience the most staunchly held views are based on ignorance or accepted dogma not carefully considered accumulations of facts The more you expose the intricacies and realtities of the situation the less things fire laser at mirror The fossil record implies trial and error the inability to anticipate the future features inconsistent with Great Designer though not Designer of more remote and indirect temperament Every time you understand something religion becomes less likely Only with the discovery of the double helix and the ensuing genetic revolution have we had grounds for thinking that the powers held traditionally to be the exclusive property of the gods might one day be ours Science is not separate from politics As much as would like it to be pure thing existing only in some intellectual realm unsullied by human struggle it will always be entangled with the world we live thing is very dangerous to have fixed idea person with fixed idea will always find some way of convincing himself in the end that he is those things beyond science which really matter and about which it is so difficult to questions come to mind How influenced by contemporary religions were many of the scholars who wrote the texts available today How many scholars have simply assumed that males have always played the dominant role in leadership and creative invention and projected this assumption into their analysis of ancient cultures Why do so many people educated in this century think of classical as the first major culture when written language was in use and great cities built at least centuries before that time And perhaps most important why is it continually inferred that the age of the pagan religions the time of the worship of female deities if mentioned at all was dark and chaotic mysterious and evil without the light of order and reason that supposedly accompanied the later male religions when it has been archaeologically confirmed that the earliest law government medicine agriculture architecture metallurgy wheeled vehicles ceramics textiles and written language were initially developed in societies that worshiped the

herself by the into history saying to science and paternalistically governed and driven organizations You have gone far enough We are going to turn the world upside down Your science is going to be shown up for what it is nothing more than pleasant metaphor usefully extrapolated into the production of toys for healthy children what science is good is not some at whose feet every point of view from astrology to acupressure to channeling need be laid to have the hand of science announce thumbs up or thumbs for the delay said was required to make bomb In modern physics there is no such thing as nothing Even in perfect vacuum pairs of virtual particles are constantly being created and destroyed The existence of these particles is no mathematical fiction Though they cannot be directly observed the effects they create are quite real The assumption that they exist leads to predictions that have been confirmed by experiment to high degree of is not matter of whether one is biased or not It is really question of which bias is the best bias with which to be times have scientific value These are occasions good learner would not is no god and the simple truth If every trace of any single religion were wiped out and nothing were passed on it would never be created exactly that way again There might be some other nonsense in its place but not that exact nonsense If all of science were wiped out it would still be true and someone would find way to figure it all out is too wonderful to be true if it be consistent with the laws of nature أنت تجد في الشرق أحد اثنين تجد من يرفض

this world perfection is an illusion of all those who utter the contrary this is the reality Obviously mediocre fools will forever lust for perfection and seek it out However what meaning is there in perfection None Not bit After perfection there exists nothing higher Not even room for creation which means there is no room for wisdom or talent either Understand To scientists like ourselves perfection is despair Human beings are ultimately nothing but for genes They ride us into the ground like racehorses from generation to generation Genes think about what constitutes good or evil They care whether we are happy or unhappy just means to an end for them The only thing they think about is what is most efficient for we lose our fear of being tiny we find ourselves on the threshold of vast and awesome Universe which dwarfs in time in space and in potential the tidy anthropocentric proscenium of our instance Well for instance what it means to be man In city In century In transition In mass Transformed by science Under organized power Subject to tremendous controls In condition caused by mechanization After the late failure of radical hopes In society that was no community and devalued the person Owing to the multiplied power of numbers which made the self negligible Which spent military billions against foreign enemies but would not pay for order at home Which permitted savagery and barbarism in its own great cities At the same time the pressure of human millions who have discovered what concerted efforts and thoughts can do As megatons of water shape organisms on the ocean floor As tides polish stones As winds hollow cliffs The beautiful supermachinery opening new life for innumerable mankind Would you deny them the right to exist Would you ask them to labor and go hungry while you yourself enjoyed Values You you yourself are child of this mass and brother to all the rest or else an ingrate dilettante idiot There thought since you ask for the instance is the way it objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience but simply as irreducible posits comparable epistemologically to the gods of For my part do qua lay physicist believe in physical objects and not in gods and consider it scientific error to believe otherwise But in point of epistemological footing the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as cultural is certain seductiveness about dead things You can ill treat alter and recolour dead It won complain Words too have genuine substance mass and weight and specific most peculiar psychology this business of Science is based on faith too so there Typically this is said by people who claim that faith is good thing Then why do they say Science is based on faith too in that tone rather than as compliment And rather dangerous compliment to give one would think from their perspective If science is based on faith then science is of the same kind as religion directly comparable If science is religion it is the religion that heals the sick and reveals the secrets of the stars It would make sense to say The priests of science can blatantly publicly verifiably walk on the Moon as miracle and your priests faith do the same Are you sure you wish to go there oh faithist Perhaps on further reflection you would prefer to retract this whole business of Science is religion too We are not born into the world We are born into something that we make into the the fate of all creators They fall in love with their science the art the jurisprudence the chief political and social theories of the modern world have grown out of and not by favour of but in the teeth of the fundamental teachings of early to which science art and any serious occupation with the things of this world were alike was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life It was almost as incredible as if you fired inch shell at piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you Recalling in the discovery of the nucleus in when some alpha particles were observed instead of travelling through very thin gold foil were seen to rebound backward as if striking something much more massive than the particles themselves He won the Prize in Chemistry for this discovery All killer whales are named You knew that right is one of the subtlest and most difficult of the sciences and arts There is more opportunity for errors of comprehension judgement and practice than in any other branch of tell us what we should do It only tells us what are no foolish questions and no man becomes fool until he has stopped asking tells matter how to move matter tells spacetime how to curve something in science like the shine of the driving back all sorts of darkness and madness The best scientist is open to experience and begins with romance the idea that anything is is first wrested the whereabouts from the stars and locked the secret in pocket secrets of evolution are time and death an unbroken thread that stretches from those first cells to done impossible things this morning why not round it off with breakfast at the at the End of the Universe Nature is not to be understood as that which is just nor as the power of Nature The wood is forest of timber the mountain quarry of rock the river is the wind is wind in the sails As the environment is discovered the Nature thus discovered is encountered too If its kind of Being as is disregarded this Nature itself can be discovered and defined simply in its pure But when this happens the Nature which stirs and strives which assails us and enthralls us as landscape remains hidden The plants are not the flowers of the hedgerow the source which the geographer establishes for river is not the springhead in the dale This is the concentration camp and crematorium at This is where people were turned into numbers Into this pond were flushed the ashes of some four million people And that was not done by gas It was done by arrogance It was done by dogma It was done by ignorance When people believe that they have absolute knowledge with no test in reality this is how they has always persecuted too long ago thousands spent their lives as recluses to find spiritual vision in the solitude of nature Modern man need not become hermit to achieve this goal for it is neither ecstasy nor mysticism his era demands but balance between quantitative and qualitative reality Modern man with his reduced capacity for intuitive perception is unlikely to benefit from the contemplative life of hermit in the wilderness But what he can do is to give undivided attention at times to natural phenomenon observing it in detail and recalling all the scientific facts about it he may remember Gradually however he must silence his thoughts and for moments at least forget all his personal cares and desires until nothing remains in his soul but awe for the miracle before him Such efforts are like journeys beyond the boundaries of narrow and although the process of intuitive awakening is laborious and slow its rewards are noticeable from the very first If pursued through the course of years something will begin to stir in the human soul sense of kinship with the forces of life consciousness which rule the world of plants and animals and with the powers which determine the laws of matter While analytical intellect may well be called the most precious fruit of the Modern Age it must not be allowed to rule supreme in matters of cognition If science is to bring happiness and real progress to the world it needs the warmth of heart just as much as the cold inquisitiveness of his shall never achieve harmony with the land anymore than we shall achieve absolute justice or liberty for people In these higher aspirations the important thing is not to achieve but to curious mind embraces science the gifted and sensitive the arts the practical business the leftover becomes an now science is the belief system that is hundreds of years old And like the medieval system before it science is starting not to fit the world any more Science has attained so much power that its practical limits begin to be apparent Largely through science billions of us live in one small world densely packed and intercommunicating But science cannot help us decide what to do with that world or how to live Science can make nuclear reactor but it cannot tell us not to build it Science can make pesticide but cannot tell us not to use it And our world starts to seem polluted in fundamental and water and of ungovernable moves in world that is nothing more or less than his consciousness objectified telling God what to do with his ride bicycle is in itself some protection against superstitious fears since the bicycle is the product of pure reason applied to motion Geometry at the service of man Give me two spheres and straight line and will show you how far can take them himself might have invented the bicycle since it contributes so much to man welfare and nothing at all to his bane Beneficial to the health it emits no harmful fumes and permits only the most decorous speeds How can bicycle ever be an implement of harm The essence of science is that it is always willing to abandon given idea for better one the essence of theology is that it holds its truths to be eternal and planet one principles and laws do not lie on the surface of nature They are hidden and must be wrested from nature by an active and elaborate technique of inquiry await your sentence with less fear than you pass it The time will come when all will see what is the agent of reason against organized is therefore one of the keys to human social and civic greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential whirls have little whirls That feed on their velocity And little whirls have lesser whirls And so on to look down on stuff like geography and meteorology and not only because standing on one and being soaked by the other They look quite like real science But geography is only physics slowed down and with few trees stuck on it and meteorology is full of excitingly fashionable chaos and complexity And summer time place as well Summer is moving creature and likes to go south for the the beginning of time spirituality and religion have been called to fill in the gaps that science did not manner of speaking As we intend for you to found dynasty And that dynasty will rule society until it has progressed enough to Overthrow the dynasty in revolutionary blood filled coup said all looked at him Just saying He sheepishly took bite of is the topography of Fiction Any scientific acclaim that omits theologians lie about the cradle of every science as the strangled snakes beside that of and history records that whenever science and orthodoxy have been fairly opposed the latter has been forced to retire from the lists bleeding and crushed if not annihilated scotched if not is more humbling than to look with strong magnifying glass at an insect so tiny that the naked eye sees only the barest speck and to discover that nevertheless it is sculpted and articulated and striped with the same care and imagination as zebra Apparently it does not occur to nature whether or not creature is within our range of vision and the suspicion arises that even the zebra was not designed for our is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labour of

wavelengths and frequencies The complexities of the universe have been shredded into mathematical equations Even our as human beings has been destroyed feel very strongly indeed that education for our scientists should include some contact with the humanistic side The gift of expression is important to them as scientists the best research is wasted when it is extremely difficult to discover what it is all about It is even more important when scientists are called upon to play their part in the world of affairs as is happening to an increasing always reemerges from the chaos It will never go away civilization defends itself from the forces of with metis or technology Technology is built on science Science is like the alchemists uroburos continually eating its own tail The process of science

reason who function in the real world of cause and effect and those who numbed by isolation and despair now seek meaning in mythical world of intuition world that is no longer world of it more probable that nature should go out of her course or that man should tell lie We have never seen in our time nature go out of her course But we have good reason to believe that millions of lies have been told in the same time It is therefore at least millions to one that the reporter of miracle tells lie will tell you why we have these extraordinary minds and souls Miss he continued as though he had not heard her We have them because there is supreme intelligence in the universe which wishes for communion with us This supreme intelligence longs to be known It calls out to us It draws us close to its mystery and grants us these remarkable minds in order that we try to reach for it It wants us to find it It wants union with us more than those people who hold up the Bible as an inspiration tomoral rectitude have the slightest notion of what is actually writtenin it was like psychology pseudoscience trying to hide that fact with intense theoretical hyperelaboration And gross domestic product was one of those unfortunate measurement concepts like inches or the thermal unit that ought to have been retired long is also worth noting that one can obtain in any branch of science for no other purpose than to make cynical use of scientific language in an effort to rationalize the glaring inadequacies of tbe Bible handful of appear to have done this some have even obtained their degrees from reputable universities No doubt others will follow in their footsteps While such people are technically scientists they are not behaving like scientists They simply are not engaged in an honest inquiry into the nature of the universe And their proclamations about God and the failures of do not in the least signify that there is legitimate scientific controversy about metric one milliliter of water occupies one cubic centimeter weighs one gram and requires one calorie of energy to heat up by one degree centigrade which is percent of the difference between its freezing point and its boiling point An amount of hydrogen weighing the same amount has exactly one mole of atoms in it Whereas in the system the answer to How much energy does it take to boil gallon of water is Go fuck yourself because you can directly relate any of those one infers god from the simple from the known from what is understood but from the complex from the unknown and incomprehensible Our ignorance is God what we know is very nature of the quantum theory forces us to regard the coordination and the claim of causality the union of which characterizes the classical theories as complementary but exclusive features of the description symbolizing the idealization of observation and description who replies to words of doubtdoth put the light of knowledge book were written all

preoccupation with the method of science mean the method of reducing the explanation of natural phenomena to the smallest possible number of primitive natural laws and in mathematics of unifying the treatment of different topics by using generalization Philosophers constantly see the method of science before their eyes and are irresistibly tempted to ask and answer in the way science does This tendency is the real source of metaphysics and leads the philosopher into complete darkness want to say here that it can never be our job to reduce anything to anything or to explain anything Philosophy really is purely conclusion it appears that nothing can be more improving to young naturalist than journey in distant history of man is simply the history of slavery of injustice and brutality together with the means by which he has through the dead and desolate years slowly and painfully advanced He has been the sport and prey of priest and king the food of superstition and cruel

development Upon the back of industry has been the whip Upon the brain have been the fetters of superstition Nothing has been left undone by the enemies of freedom Every art and artifice every cruelty and outrage has been practiced and perpetrated to destroy the rights of man In this great struggle every crime has been rewarded and every virtue has been punished Reading writing thinking and investigating have all been science has been an the altars and all the thrones united to arrest the forward march of the human race The king said that mankind must not work for themselves The priest said that mankind must not think for themselves One forged chains for the hands the other for the soul Under this infamous regime the eagle of the human intellect was for ages slimy serpent of human

sacrifice Love and allegiance At the very apex of callousness you will find only ones and great mistake in education is as it seems to me the worship of the confusion of instruction and education We strain the memory instead of cultivating the mind The children in our elementary schools are wearied by the mechanical act of writing and the interminable intricacies of spelling they are oppressed by columns of dates by lists of kings and places which convey no definite idea to their minds and have no near relation to their daily wants and occupations while in our public schools the same unfortunate results are produced by the weary monotony of and grammar We ought to follow exactly the opposite course with children to give them wholesome variety of mental food and endeavor to cultivate their tastes rather than to fill their minds with dry facts The important thing is not so much that every child should be taught as that every child should be given the wish to learn What does it matter if the pupil know little more or little less boy who leaves school knowing much but hating his lessons will soon have forgotten almost all he ever learned while another who had acquired thirst for knowledge even if he had learned little would soon teach himself more than the first ever without conscience is the when hearing about latest book said they tell me you have written this large book on the system of the universe and have never even mentioned its creator responds Je pas besoin de cette had no need of that hypothesis Science is as corruptible human activity as any other nation that control its energy sources control its the tales of miracles with which the Old and New are filled are fit only for impostors to preach and fools to believe do not like odd things until can understand talks of progress because by the aid of few scientific discoveries he has established society which has mistaken comfort for and attributes must be accommodated to the essence of things and not the essence to the names since things come first and names the admirable gift of himself and for the magnificent service he renders humanity what reward does our society offer the scientist Have these servants of an idea the necessary means of work Have they an assured existence sheltered from care The example of and of others shows that they have none of these things and that more often before they can secure possible working conditions they have to exhaust their youth and their powers in daily anxieties Our society in which reigns an eager desire for riches and luxury does not understand the value of science It does not realize that science is most precious part of its moral patrimony Nor does it take sufficient cognizance of the fact that science is at the base of all the progress that lightens the burden of life and lessens its suffering Neither public powers nor private generosity actually accord to science and to scientists the support and the subsidies indispensable to fully effective the people of had known as much of astronomy and geology when the bible was introduced among them as they do now there never could have been one believer in the doctrine of inspiration If the writers of the various parts of the bible had known as much about the sciences as is now known by every intelligent man the book never could have been written It was produced by ignorance and has been believed and defended by its author It has lost power in the proportion that man has gained knowledge few years ago this book was appealed to in the settlement of all scientific questions but now even the clergy confess that in such matters it has ceased to speak with the voice of authority For the establishment of facts the word of man is now considered far better than the word of God In the world of science was superseded by and All that God told admitting the entire account to be true is dust and ashes compared to the discoveries of and In matters of fact the bible has ceased to be regarded as standard Science has succeeded in breaking the chains of theology few years ago Science endeavored to show that it was not inconsistent with the bible The tables have been turned and now Religion is endeavoring to prove that the bible is not inconsistent with Science The standard has been assumption of an absolute determinism is the essential foundation of every scientific is our task both in science and in society at large to prove the conventional wisdom wrong and to make our unpredictable dreams come is piece of furniture for upper chamber if he has common sense on the ground floor will argue that every scrap of biological diversity is priceless to be learned and cherished and never to be surrendered without all what else is scientific enquiry of any sort other than controlled version of banging head against the universe until something gives concluded that every medium develops some cognitive skills at the expense of With Me In The Of My Work Because My Brain Feels Like It Has Been And Yearn To Make Small Perfect Thing Which Will Live In Your Morning Like Curious Through Or Acquiring Tan On The Crowded From the scientific view the theory of karma may be metaphysical assumption but it is no more so than the assumption that all of life is material and originated out of pure is sometimes called new science This is quite wrong Psychology is perhaps the oldest science and unfortunately in its most essential features forgotten in the universe can travel at the speed of light they say forgetful of the shadow with an exciting question science tended to provide the dullest possible to scientists there are three stages of love lust attraction and attachment And it turns out each of the stages is orchestrated by chemicals neurotransmitters in the you might expect lust is ruled by testosterone and second stage attraction is governed by dopamine and serotonin When for example couples report feeling indescribably happy in each other presence that dopamine the pleasure hormone doing its cocaine fosters the same level of euphoria In fact scientists who study both the brains of new lovers and cocaine addicts are to tell the second chemical of the attraction phase is serotonin When couples confess that they can stop thinking about each other it because their serotonin level has dropped People in love have the same low serotonin levels as people with The reason they can stop thinking about each other is that they are literally and vasopressin control the third stage attachment or bonding is released during orgasm and makes you feel closer to the person you ve had sex with It also released during childbirth and helps bond mother to child Vasopressin is released knows these facts cold Knowing them helped her get over betrayal So she knows love is just chemicals and why does feel like something more In eyes walking on water is no more miraculous than the ability of hemoglobin to bond with oxygen inside red blood history of astronomy is history of receding the conditions of modern life the rule is absolute the race which does not value trained intelligence is it hurts do it more frequently and bring the pain behind am lifted with gratitude Looking forward am filled with vision Looking upward am filled with strength Looking within discover is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate that there are no mysteries in nature that our triumphs are complete and that there are no new worlds to is profound and necessary truth that the deep things in science are not found because they are useful they are found because it was possible to find you want to teach your children that they are the tools of God you had better not teach them that they are rifles or we will have to stand firmly opposed to you your doctrine has no glory no special rights no intrinsic and inalienable merit If you insist on teaching your children that the Earth is flat that Man is not product of evolution by natural selection then you must expect at the very least that those of us who have freedom of speech will feel free to describe your teachings as the spreading of falsehoods and will attempt to demonstrate this to your children at our earliest opportunity Our future the of all of us on the planet depends on the education of our mindless tolerance which places observable scientific facts subject to proof on the same level as unprovable supernatural fantasy has played major role in the resurgence of both and is not what the man of science believes that distinguishes him but how and why he believes it His beliefs are tentative not dogmatic they are based on evidence not on authority or in biology makes sense except in the light of things get too complicated it sometimes makes sense to stop and wonder Have asked the right question Myths whether in written or visual form serve vital role of asking unanswerable questions and providing unquestionable answers Most of us most of the time have low tolerance for ambiguity and uncertainty We want to reduce the cognitive dissonance of not knowing by filling the gaps with answers Traditionally religious myths have served that role but today the age of science science fiction is our mythology think we have different value systems Well better the network of relationships linking the human race to itself and to the rest of the biosphere is so complex that all aspects affect all others to an extraordinary degree Someone should be studying the whole system however crudely that has to be done because no gluing together of partial studies of complex nonlinear system can give good idea of the behavior of the whole One of the great achievements of science has been if not to make it impossible for intelligent people to be religious then at least to make it possible for them not to be religious We should not retreat from this something unusual happened was walking without even knowing where was going was smiling without any cause was just happy without reasons can tell you that birds do sing leaves of trees do dance and it beautiful am complete nature boy Maybe was fully satisfied that sunlight was falling on my cheek got the power to love myself nature and rest of humankind Everyone This was the scientific age and people wanted to believe that their traditions were in line with the new era but this was impossible if you thought that these myths should be understood literally Hence the furor occasioned by The Origin of Species published by The book was not intended as an attack on religion but was sober exploration of scientific hypothesis But because by this time people were reading the cosmogonies of as though they were factual many still the whole edifice of faith was in jeopardy Creation stories had never been regarded as historically accurate their purpose was therapeutic But once you start reading as scientifically valid you have bad science and bad have power by virtue of the respect commanded by the discipline We live with poets and politicians preachers and philosophers All have their ways of knowing and all are valid in their proper domain The world is too complex and interesting for one way to hold all the can get into habit of thought in which you enjoy making fun of all those other people who see things as clearly as you do We have to guard carefully against religion makes scores of purportedly factual assertions about everything from the creation of the universe to the afterlife But on what grounds can believers presume to know that these assertions are true The reasons they give are various but the ultimate justification for most religious people beliefs is simple one we believe what we believe because our holy scriptures say so But how then do we know that our holy scriptures are factually accurate Because the scriptures themselves say so Theologians specialize in weaving elaborate webs of verbiage to avoid saying anything quite so bluntly but this gem of circular reasoning really is the epistemological bottom line on which all faith is grounded In the words of By the authority of his absolute transcendence God who makes himself known is also the source of the credibility of what he reveals It goes without saying that this begs the question of whether the texts at issue really were authored or inspired by God and on what grounds one knows this Faith is not in fact rejection of reason but simply lazy acceptance of bad reasons Faith is the that some people trot out when they want to make claims without the necessary of course we never apply these lax standards of evidence to the claims made in the other fellow holy scriptures when it comes to religions other than one own religious people are as rational as everyone else Only our own religion whatever it may be seems to merit some special dispensation from the general standards of here it seems to me is the crux of the conflict between religion and science Not the religious rejection of specific scientific theories be it heliocentrism in the 17th century or evolutionary biology today over time most religions do find some way to make peace with science Rather the scientific worldview and the religious worldview come into conflict over far more fundamental question namely what constitutes relies on publicly reproducible sense experience that is experiments and observations combined with rational reflection on those empirical observations Religious people acknowledge the validity of that method but then claim to be in the possession of additional methods for obtaining reliable knowledge of factual matters methods that go beyond the mere assessment of empirical evidence such as intuition revelation or the reliance on sacred texts But the trouble is this What good reason do we have to believe that such methods work in the sense of steering us systematically even if not invariably towards true beliefs rather than towards false ones At least in the domains where we have been able to test these methods astronomy geology and history for instance they have not proven terribly reliable Why should we expect them to work any better when we apply them to problems that are even more difficult such as the fundamental nature of the universe Last but not least these methods suffer from an insuperable logical problem What should we do when different people intuitions or revelations conflict How can we know which of the many purportedly sacred texts whose assertions frequently contradict one another are in fact sacred Yes yes see it all an enormous social activity mighty civilization profuseness of science of art of industry of morality and afterwords when we have filled the world with industrial marvels with great factories with roads museums and libraries we shall fall exhausted at the foot of it all and it will subsist for whom Was man made for science or was science made for man It is the man of science eager to have his every opinion regenerated his every idea rationalized by drinking at the fountain of fact and devoting all the energies of his life to the cult of truth not as he understands it but as he does not yet understand it that ought properly to be called are no things man was not meant to know There are perhaps things man is too dumb to figure out but different is convenient for the old men to blame To insist we are damned because country girl talked to the snake one afternoon long ago Children must starve in for that and old women be abandoned in our greatest cities It why we will finally be thrown into the lakes of molten lead Because she was confused by happiness that first time anyone said she was beautiful Nevertheless she must be the issue so people won notice that rocks and galaxies mathematics and rust are also created in His image am very much out of my element here There are moments listening to the conversations going on around me when feel am going to lose my mind Earlier today heard someone say the words felt at one with the divine source of creation on conducted tour of had to fight the urge to push back my chair and start screaming STAND BACK ALL OF YOU GOT AN BOX Instead quietly excused myself and went to the bar to commune with spirits know how to relate are ill discoverers that think there is no land when they can see nothing but nutshell the universe is visible undetectable and unimaginable Welcome to the cosmos full of mass you can measure but not manhandle driven by force you can infer but not explain walk up and down the rows The heads look like rubber halloween masks They also look like human heads but my brain has no precedent for human heads on tables or in roasting pans or anywhere other than on top of human bodies and so think it has chosen to interpret the sight in more comforting manner Here we are at the rubber mask factory Look at the nice men and woman working on the In woman in received patent for Wrap The patent included three pages of drawings including penis wearing ghost outfit another in the robes of the and one dressed up to look like snowman has feeling for the central order of things He can detect it in the simplicity of natural laws We may take it that he felt this simplicity very strongly and directly during his discovery of the theory of relativity Admittedly this is far cry from the contents of religion believe is tied to any religious tradition and rather think the idea of personal God is entirely foreign to do we change the way science is taught Ask anybody how many teachers truly made difference in their life and you never come up with more than the fingers on one hand You remember their names you remember what they did you remember how they moved in front of the classroom You know why you remember them Because they were passionate about the subject You remember them because they lit flame within you They got you excited about subject you previously care about because they were excited about it themselves what turns people on to careers in science and engineering and mathematics what we need to promote Put that in every classroom and it will change the world am using the word theory as scientist means it set of ideas so well established by observations and physical models that it is essentially indistinguishable from fact That is different from the colloquial use that means guess To scientist you can bet your life on theory Remember gravity is just theory believe that it is possible for scientific work to gain some knowledge about the reality of the world by means of which we can increase out power and in accordance with which we can arrange our life If this belief is an illusion then we are in the same position as you But science has given us evidence by its numerous and important successes that it is no the hopes have confessed to are of an illusory nature too But hold fast to one distinction Apart from the fact that no penalty is imposed for not sharing them my illusions are not like religious ones incapable of question is whether any civilization can wage relentless war on life without destroying itself and without losing the right to be called la nature rien ne se crée rien ne se perd tout nature nothing is created nothing is lost everything only goes so far then comes God has brought mankind through the Dark Ages to its present state of civilization Imagination led to discover Imagination led to discover electricity Imagination has given us the steam engine the telephone the and the automobile for these things had to be dreamed of before they became realities So believe that dreams day dreams you know with your eyes wide open and your whizzing are likely to lead to the betterment of the world The imaginative child will become the imaginative man or woman most apt to create to invent and therefore to foster aim of science is to seek the simplest explanations of complex facts We are apt to fall into the error of thinking that the facts are simple because simplicity is the goal of our quest The guiding motto in the life of every natural philosopher should be Seek simplicity and distrust as far as he is scientific man as far as he knows anything he is materialist outside his science in spheres about which he knows nothing he translates his ignorance into and calls it is interesting to note how many of the great scientific discoveries begin as is driven by abstractions like seeking should never wait for science to give us permission to do the uncommon if we do then we are turning science into another scientific ideas never spring from communal body however organized but rather from the head of an individually inspired researcher who struggles with his problems in lonely thought and unites all his thought on one single point which is his whole world for the is the search for the is not game in which one tries to beat his opponent to do harm to others We need to have the spirit of science in international affairs to make the conduct of international affairs the effort to find the right solution the just solution of international problems and not an effort by each nation to get the better of other nations to do harm to them when it is possible believe in morality in justice in humanitarianism maintain that the human mystery is incredibly demeaned by scientific reductionism with its claim in promissory materialism to account eventually for all of the spiritual world in terms of patterns of neuronal activity This belief must be classed as superstition we have to recognize that we are spiritual beings with souls existing in spiritual world as well as material beings with bodies and brains existing in material world When asked by student if he believes in any gods Oh no Absolutely not The biggest advantage to believing in God is you have to understand anything no physics no biology wanted to understand have no responsibility to live up to what others expect of me their mistake not my long for permanence but everything in the known universe is transient That fact but one we of the people have any real interest in science who only begin to be enthusiastic about it when they themselves have made discoveries in scientists reality is not optional man craves ultimate truths Every mortal mind think is that way But what is ultimate truth the end of the road where there is no more mystery no more hope And no more questions to ask since all the answers have been given But there is no such Universe is labyrinth made of labyrinths Each leads to another And wherever we cannot go ourselves we reach with mathematics Out of mathematics we build wagons to carry us into the nonhuman realms of the is chemical reaction But it cannot be fully understood or defined by though body cannot exist without soul It too cannot be fully understood or defined by is the most powerful form of energy But science cannot decipher its the best cure for sick soul is love

Love deeply quickly Take chances and never have regrets Forget the past but remember what it taught don have real difference is this the says that he has knowledge the Agnostic admits that he has none and yet the accuses the Agnostic of arrogance and asks him how he has the impudence to admit the limitations of his mind To the Agnostic every fact is torch and by this light and this light only he Agnostic knows that the testimony of man is not sufficient to establish what is known as the miraculous We would not believe the testimony of millions to the effect that the dead had been raised The church itself would be the first to attack such testimony If we cannot believe those whom we know why should we believe witnesses who have been dead thousands of years and about whom we know nothing The Agnostic takes the ground that human experience is the basis of morality it is of no importance who wrote the gospels or who vouched or vouches for the genuineness of the miracles In his scheme of life these things are utterly unimportant He is satisfied that the versus them is not in our genes It is something we sama pentingnya dengan matematika memanusiakan manusia menciptakan rasa very

seems to me irresistible and cannot imagine that anybody of truly poetic sensibility could disagree am older than you Believe me there is no other way to live on earth Men are not open to truth or reason They cannot be reached by rational argument The mind is powerless against them Yet we have to deal with them If we want to accomplish anything we have to deceive them into letting us accomplish

will draw more good than evil from new every man there is child In every woman there is mother The scientific method once wrote is nothing but the normal working of the human mind That is to say when the mind is working that is to say further when it is engaged in corrrecting its this point of view we may conclude that science is not physics biology or not even subject but moral imperative drawn

philosophy astronomy alchemy and ethics The first pillar is the philosophical knowledge of earth and water the second astronomy supplies its full understanding of that which is of fiery and airy

fourth shows the physician those virtues which must stay with him up until his death and it should support and complete the three other at some level scientists know nanobots will destroy mankind They just resist seeing how it are some men who are counted great because they represent the actuality of their own age and mirror it as it is Such an one was of whom it was epigrammatically said he expressed thoughts better than anyone But there are other men who attain greatness because they embody the potentiality of their own day and magically reflect the future They express the thoughts which will be two or three centuries after them Such as one was theories on the creation of the Universe state that if it were created at all and just start as it were unofficially it came to being between ten and twenty thousand million years ago By the same token the earth itself is generally supposed to be about four and half thousand million years dates are scholars put the date of the

otherwise everyone would find out how simple it faith in the expertise of physicists like for instance permits me to endorse and if it comes to it bet heavily on the truth of proposition that understand So far my faith is not unlike religious faith but am not in the slightest bit motivated to go to my death rather than recant the formulas of physics Watch equal mc2 it it was lying so there The myth of quantum consciousness sits well with many whose egos have made it impossible for them to accept the insignificant place science perceives for humanity as modern instruments probe the farthest reaches of space and time quantum consciousness has about as much substance as the aether from which it is composed Early in this century quantum mechanics and relativity destroyed the notion of holistic universe that had seemed within the realm of possibility in the century just past First did away with the aether shattering the doctrine that we all move about inside universal cosmic fluid whose excitations connect us simultaneously to one another and to the rest of the universe Second and other physicists proved that matter and light were composed of particles wiping away the notion of universal continuity Atomic theory and quantum mechanics demonstrated that everything even space and time exists in discrete bits quanta To turn this around and say that twentieth century physics initiated some new holistic view of the universe is complete misrepresentation of what actually took place The myth of quantum consciousness should take its place along with gods unicorns and dragons as yet another product of the fantasies of people unwilling to accept what science reason and their own eyes tell them about the is often said that there are very few places left on earth that have yet to be discovered But those who say this are usually referring to places that exist at the human scale Take magnifying glass to any part of your house and you will find whole new world to explore Use powerful microscope and you will find another complete with zoo of living organisms of the most fantastic nature use telescope and whole universe of possibilities will open up before long reflection in solitude and meditation suddenly had the idea during the year that the discovery made by in should be generalised by extending it to all material particles and notably to purpose of science is not everything to physical level and measure but to penetrate deeper into the realm beyond the sensory perceptions and bring more knowledge and wisdom to the so hard to balance in our minds the knowledge that the world is mundanely planet The former is so holy the latter merely science we proceed from the known into the unknown we may hope to understand but we may have to learn at the same time new meaning of the word understanding think whole populations are villainous but are just extraordinarily unaware of all kinds of things If you live in the middle of that vast continent with apparently everything your heart could wish for just because you were born there then why worry If people lose knowledge sympathy and understanding of the natural world going to mistreat it and will not ask their politicians to care for from what we now know about the cosmos to think that all this was created for just one species among the tens of millions of species who live on one planet circling one of couple of hundred billion stars that are located in one galaxy among hundreds of billions of galaxies all of which are in one universe among perhaps an infinite number of universes all nestled within grand cosmic multiverse is provincially insular and anthropocentrically blinkered Which is more likely That the universe was designed just for us or that we see the universe as having been designed just for us There is no indisputable proof for the big bang said And there is none for evolution And yet you accept those Why hold the question of whether there is creator to higher standard Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to compute most accessible field in science from the point of view of language is astrophysics What do you call spots on the sun of space you fall into and you don come out of Black holes Big red stars Red giants So take my fellow scientists to task He ll use his word and if understand it ll say Oh does that mean arranged civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology This is prescription for clubs are where learn the laws of is the natural tendency of the ignorant to believe what is not true In order to overcome that tendency it is not sufficient to exhibit the true it is also necessary to expose and denounce the false To admit that the false has any standing in court that it ought to be handled gently because millions of morons cherish it and thousands of quacks make their livings propagating it to admit this as the more fatuous of the reconcilers of science and religion inevitably do is to abandon just cause to its enemies cravenly and without the Lichen are just about the hardiest visible organisms on Earth but the least is this mythical or rather symbolic content of the religious traditions which is likely to come into conflict with science This occurs whenever this religious stock of ideas contains dogmatically fixed statements on subjects which belong in the domain of biologists have ignored it is not because is not pervasive and profound It is because we biologists have yet to understand how to think about systems governed simultaneously by two sources of order Yet who seeing the snowflake who seeing simple lipid molecules cast adrift in water forming themselves into hollow lipid vesicles who seeing the potential for the crystallization of life in swarms of reacting molecules who seeing the stunning order for free in networks linking tens upon tens of thousands of variables can fail to entertain central thought if ever we are to attain final theory in biology we will surely surely have to understand the commingling of and selection We will have to see that we are the natural expressions of deeper order Ultimately we will discover in our creation myth that we are expected after tendency has always been strong to believe that whatever received name must be an entity or being having an independent existence of its own And if no real entity answering to the name could be found men did not for that reason suppose that none existed but imagined that it was something peculiarly abstruse and life seems to recede further and further away from nature and closely connected with this fact we seem to be losing the feeling of reverence towards nature It is probably inevitable when science and machinery capitalism and materialism go hand in hand so far in most remarkably successful manner Mysticism which is the life of religion in whatever sense we understand it has come to be relegated altogether in the background Without certain amount of mysticism there is no appreciation for the feeling of reverence and along with it for the spiritual significance of humility Science and scientific technique have done great deal for humanity but as far as our spiritual welfare is concerned we have not made any advances over that attained by our forefathers In fact we are suffering at present the worst kind of unrest all over the can ask why the has to appear in the cogito argument think therefore am since the cogito if used rightly is the awareness of pure consciousness not directed at any fact or action In fact the is not necessary here since it is never united directly to consciousness One can even imagine pure and consciousness

day you do you will also stop the force of the skies Men once recognised it can be put to outside the box Indeed But to add balance to that one should not in the process forget what the inside of the

insight Insight must be value the world sets upon motives is often grossly unjust and inaccurate Consider for example two of them mere insatiable curiosity and the desire to do good The latter is put high above the former and yet it is the former that moves one of the most useful men the human race has yet produced the scientific investigator What actually urges him on is not some brummagem idea of Service but boundless almost pathological thirst to penetrate the unknown to uncover the secret to find out what has not been found out before His prototype is not the liberator releasing slaves the good lifting up the fallen but dog sniffing tremendously at an infinite series of die when they are proved to be true Science is the record of dead only lasts until you find new unbelievable hard sounds like our best bet as an energy source But with world electricity consumption pushing terawatts it would take hundred million to meet our demands All things considered switching to power probably worth the trouble though it would definitely be err is human to persist in error is reader of an early draft of this chapter complained at this point saying that by treating the hypothesis of God as just one more scientific hypothesis to be evaluated by the standards of science in particular and rational thought in general and are ignoring the very widespread claim by believers in God that their faith is quite beyond reason not matter to which such mundane methods of testing applies It is not just unsympathetic he claimed but strictly unwarranted for me simply to assume that the scientific method continues to apply with full force in this domain of well consider the objection doubt that the defender of religion will find it attractive once we explore it philosopher de once memorably described philosophical theology as intellectual tennis without net and readily allow that have indeed been assuming without comment or question up to now that the net of rational judgement was up But we can lower it if you really want your you serve suppose return service rudely as follows What you say implies that God is ham sandwich wrapped in tin foil not much of God to worship If you then volley back demanding to know how can logically justify my claim that your serve has such preposterous implication will reply oh do you want the net up for my returns but not for your serves Either way the net stays up or it stays down If the net is down there are no rules and anybody can say anything game if there ever was one have been giving you the benefit of the assumption that you would not waste your own time or mine by playing with the net has nothing to do with the conclusion and everything to do with the may not yet know the right way to go but we should at least stop going in the wrong gibt keinen und ist sein Prophet There is no God and is his Prophet remark made during the International after discussion of the religious views of various physicists at which all the participants laughed including as quoted in und das by it is an ironic play on the statement of faith the often translated There is no god but and is his Prophet do not consider myself religious person because adhere to particular religion or faith or prescribed beliefs as did my father who was minister And am not an atheist one who thinks that belief in anything beyond the here and now and the rational is delusion love science but allow for mystery things that can never be proven by rational mind am person who thinks about the nature of the spirit when write think about what be known and only imagined often sense spirit or force or meaning beyond myself leave it open as to what the spirit is but continue to make guesses that it could be the universal binding of the emotion of love or joyful quality of humanity or collective unconscious that turns out to be unified conscience The spirit could be all those worshiped by all the religions even those that deny the validity of others It could be that we all exist in all ten dimensions of universe and are seeding memories in all of them and occupy them simultaneously as memory Or we exist only as thought and out perception that it is physical world is delusion The nature of spirit could also be my mother and my grandmother and that they really do serve as my muses as fondly imagine them doing at times Or maybe the nature of the spirit is freer imagination often thought that imagination was the conduit to compassion and compassion is true spiritual nature Whatever the spirit might be am not basing what do in this life on any expected reward or punishment in the hereafter or thereafter It is enough that feel blessed and by whom or what know but receive it with gratitude that am writer and my work is to imagine all the when assigned the name quark to the fundamental constituents of the nucleon had the sound first without the spelling which could have been kwork Then in one of my occasional perusals of by came across the word quark in the phrase Three quarks for Muster Mark Since quark meaning for one thing the cry of gull was clearly intended to rhyme with Mark as well as bark and other such words had to find an excuse to pronounce it as kwork But the book represents the dreams of publican named Words in the text are typically drawn from several sources at once like the portmanteau words in Through the Looking Glass From time to time phrases occur in the book that are partially determined by calls for drinks at the bar argued therefore that perhaps one of the multiple sources of the cry Three quarks for Muster Mark might be Three quarts for Mark in which case the pronunciation kwork would not be totally unjustified In any case the number three fitted perfectly the way quarks occur in Come here want to see you First intelligible words spoken over the telephone Wind is renewable are only are there meaningless questions but many of the problems with which the human intellect has tortured itself turn out to be only pseudo problems because they can be formulated only in terms of questions which are meaningless Many of the traditional problems of philosophy of religion or of ethics are of this character Consider for example the problem of the freedom of the will You maintain that you are free to take either the right or the fork in the road defy you to set up single objective criterion by which you can prove after you have made the turn that you might have made the other The problem has no meaning in the sphere of objective activity it only relates to my personal subjective feelings while making the religions dread the advance of science as witches do the approach of daylight and scowl on the fatal harbinger announcing the subversions of the duperies on which they always make tools that will help us get what we want and what we want changed for thousands of years because as far as we can tell the human template changed either We still want the purse that will always be filled with gold and the Fountain of Youth We want the table that will cover itself with delicious food whenever we say the word and that will be cleaned up afterwards by invisible servants We want the Boots so we can travel very quickly and the Hat of Darkness so we can snoop on other people without being seen We want the weapon that will never miss and the castle that will keep us safe We want excitement and adventure we want routine and security We want to have large number of sexually attractive partners and we also want those we love to love us in return and be utterly faithful to us We want cute smart children who will treat us with the respect we deserve We want to be surrounded by music and by ravishing scents and attractive visual objects We want to be too hot or too cold We want to dance We want to speak with the animals We want to be envied We want to be immortal We want to be in addition we want wisdom and justice We want hope We want to be our country religion is not different from philosophy and religion philosophy don differ from science once read that if the folds in the cerebral cortex were smoothed out it would cover card table That seemed quite unbelievable but it did make me wonder just how big the cortex would be if you ironed it out thought it might just about cover pizza not bad but no was astonished to realize that nobody seems to know the answer quick search yielded the following estimates for the smoothed out dimensions of the cerebral cortex of the human article in in by claimed the cortex was square That is about ten inches by ten inches Scientific magazine in upped the ante considerably with an estimated of square metres thats square of brain forty inches on each side getting close to the estimate psychologist at the University of figured it would cover the floor of his living room seen his living room but the prize winning estimate so far is from the magazine New poster of the brain published in which claimed that the cerebral cortex if flattened out would cover tennis court How can there be such disagreement How can so many experts not know how big the cortex is know but on the hunt for an expert who will say the cortex when fully spread out will cover football field football scientists have tried to make determinism and complementarity the basis of conclusions that seem to me weak and dangerous for instance they have used uncertainty principle to bolster up human free will though his principle which applies exclusively to the behavior of electrons and is the direct result of microphysical measurement techniques has nothing to do with human freedom of choice It is far safer and wiser that the physicist remain on the solid ground of theoretical physics itself and eschew the shifting sands of philosophic are two kinds of truth the truth that lights the way and the truth that warms the heart The first of these is science and the second is art Neither is independent of the other or more important than the other Without art science would be as useless as pair of high forceps in the hands of plumber Without science art would become crude mess of folklore and emotional quackery The truth of art keeps science from becoming inhuman and the truth of science keeps art from becoming ridiculous Great Thought The only ethical principle which has made science possible is that the truth shall be told all the time If we do not penalize false statements made in error we open up the way for false statements by intention And false statement of fact made deliberately is the most serious crime scientist can commit used to pray that God would feed the hungry or do this or that but now pray that he will guide me to do whatever supposed to do what can do used to pray for answers but now praying for strength used to believe that prayer changes things but now know that prayer changes us and we change of the penalties of an ecological education is that one lives alone in world of aware of this truth that the people on this earth could be joyous if only they would live rationally and if they would contribute mutually to each others world is not vale of sorrows if you will recognize discriminatingly what is truly excellent in it and if you will avail yourself of it for mutual happiness and Therefore let us explain as often as possible and particularly at the departure of life that we base our faith on firm foundations on Truth for putting into action our ideas which do not depend on fables and ideas which Science has long ago proven to be therefore are responsible for their research not only intellectually but also morally This responsibility has become an important issue in many of sciences but especially so in physics in which the results of quantum mechanics and relativity theory have opened up two very different paths for physicists to pursue They may lead us to put it in extreme terms to the or to the Bomb and it is up to each of us to decide which path to take The point is that no matter what you choose to do with your body when you die it ultimately be very appealing If you are inclined to donate yourself to science you should not let images of dissection or dismemberment put you off They are no more or less gruesome in my opinion than ordinary decay or the sewing shut of your jaws via your nostrils for funeral the world should blow itself up the last audible voice would be that of an expert saying it be in science are sometimes made easier by adding mourned that the rainbow which as boy had been for him magic thing had lost its glory because the physicists had found it resulted merely from the refraction of the sunlight by the raindrops Yet knowledge of its causation could not spoil the rainbow for me am sure that it is not given to man to be omniscient There will always be something left to know something to excite the imagination of the poet and those attuned to the great world in which they live Cutting off fundamental science is like eating the seed corn We may have little more to eat next winter but what will we plant so we and our children will have enough to get through the winters to come It is either coincidence piled on top of coincidence said or it is deliberate is but momentary glimpse of the wonder of this astounding universe and it is sad to see so many dreaming it away on spiritual fragile is thy tenure of this haunted by the monstrous ghost of God To Science kiss without moustache they said then is like an egg without salt will add to it and it is like Good without scientific method is nothing more than system of rules to keep us from lying to each scientific thinking are always present elements of poetry Science and music requires thought has greater sense of intellectual degradation after an interview with doctor than from any human to be commanded must be obeyed The imagination must be given not wings but itulah titah ilmu pada is the name we give to the science we understand Science is the name we give to the God we seems charmingly paradoxical scientists seek one truth but often voice many opinions journalists often speak of many truths while voicing uniform true men of action in our time those who transform the world are not the politicians and statesmen but the scientists Unfortunately poetry cannot celebrate them because their deeds are concerned with things not persons and are therefore speechless When find myself in the company of scientists feel like shabby curate who has strayed by mistake into drawing room full of arrows machine guns and even high explosives have had far less power over the fates of nations than the typhus louse the plague flea and the mosquito Civilizations have retreated from the plasmodium of malaria and armies have crumbled into rabbles under the onslaught of cholera spirilla or of dysentery and typhoid bacilli Huge areas have bee devastated by the trypanosome that travels on the wings of the tsetse fly and generations have been harassed by the syphilis of courtier War and conquest and that herd existence which is an accompaniment of what we call civilization have merely set the stage for these more

could scarcely read This man acted as his servant Each morning the old man would knock on the door of the scientist and call Arise Sir it is near seven and you have great work to do en ningún momento está totalmente en lo cierto pero rara vez está completamente equivocada tiene en general mayores posibilidades de estar en lo cierto que las teorías no científicas Science requires an engagement with the world live encounter between the knower and the everybody admits that something is wrong with the world and the critics of are the very people who feel this most The most violent attacks on religion come from those who are most anxious to change the world and they attack because they think that it is an obstructive force that stands in the way of real reform of human life There has seldom been time in which men were more dissatisfied with life and the more conscious of the need for deliverance and if they turn away from it is because they feel that is servant of the established order and that it has no real power or will to change the world and to rescue man from his present difficulties They have lost their faith in the old spiritual traditions that inspired civilization in the past and they tend to look for solution in some external practical remedy such as communism or the scientific organisation of life something definite and objective that can be applied to society as whole would teach how science works as much as would teach what science knows would assert given that essentially everyone will learn to read that science literacy is the most important kind of literacy they can take into the 21st century would undervalue grades based on knowing things and find ways to reward curiosity In the end the people who are curious who change the science begins as philosophy and ends as art it arises in hypothesis and flows into study of mathematics is apt to commence in disappointment We are told that by its aid the stars are weighed and the billions of molecules in drop of water are counted Yet like the ghost of father this great science eludes the efforts of our mental weapons to grasp never solves problem without creating ten your experiment needs statistician you need better and penetrate with our limited means the secrets of nature and you will find that behind all the descernible laws and connections there remains something subtle intangible and inexplicable Veneration for this force beyond anything that we can comprehend is my religion To that extent am in fact religious had made up my mind to find that for which was searching even if it required the remainder of my life After innumerable failures finally uncovered the principle for which was searching and was astounded at its simplicity was still more astounded to discover the principle had revealed not only beneficial in the construction of mechanical hearing aid but it served as well as means of sending the sound of the voice over wire Another discovery which came out of my investigation was the fact that when man gives his order to produce definite result and stands by that order it seems to have the effect of giving him what might be termed second sight which enables him to see right through ordinary problems What this power is cannot say all know is that it exists and it becomes available only when man is in that state of mind in which he knows exactly what he wants and is fully determined not to quit until he finds it true conservationist is man who knows that the world is not given by his fathers but borrowed from his off Earth is in two important respects not at all unworldly you can choose to focus on the surprises and pleasures or the frustrations And you can choose to appreciate the smallest scraps of experience the everyday moments or to value only the grandest most stirring world keeps happening in accordance with its rules up to us to make sense of it and give it may have all the technical knowledge scientific intellect and business

les découvertes before proving Need remind you that it is so that all important discoveries have been made The ideas of were popularized by people who only imperfectly understood them who were incapable of the great effort required to grasp them in their relationship to larger truths and who therefore assigned to them prominence out of all proportion to their true inquiries carry with them some element of scientific spirit is of more value than its products and irrationally held truths may be more harmful than reasoned errors know how many of you have ever met but you probably know that arrogance in computer science is measured in to shoot for the stars if feels right Aim for my heart if it feels the seriously ruthless venomous habits and agendas of evil always instills more fierce passion and longing for closer God Men out of pride may claim their own authorities over what constitutes good and evil they may keen knowledge of subjective morality through religion or science But that is only if they are acknowledging the work of evil as petty little rain cloud in the sky that merely wants to dampen spirits On the contrary man could be without doubt lit with the strength the peace and the knowledge of the gods his gods but when or if the devils grow weary in unsuccessful attempts to torment him they begin tormenting his loved ones or if not his loved ones anyone who may attempt to grasp his philosophies No matter how godly he may become God is in the end his only hope and his only grace for the pressures built around him it is left up to higher authority and more solid peace and wider love to eclipse not just own evils but all evils for goodness to ultimately matter If all men were gods each being would dwell in separate prison cell hopeless before finally imploding into successful development of science requires proper balance to be maintained between the method of building up from observations and the method of deducing by pure reasoning from speculative is way of talking about the universe in words that bind it to common is method of talking to the universe in words that it cannot two are rarely when they were first discovered behaved exactly like particles or bullets very simply Further research showed from electron diffraction experiments for example that they behaved like waves As time went on there was growing confusion about how these things really behaved waves or particles particles or waves Everything looked like growing confusion was resolved in or with the advent of the correct equations for quantum mechanics Now we know how the electrons and light behave But what can call it If say they behave like particles give the wrong impression also if say they behave like waves They behave in their own inimitable way which technically could be called quantum mechanical way They behave in way that is like nothing that you have seen before Your experience with things that you have seen before is incomplete The behavior of things on very tiny scale is simply different An atom does not behave like weight hanging on spring and oscillating Nor does it behave like miniature representation of the solar system with little planets going around in orbits Nor does it appear to be somewhat like cloud or fog of some sort surrounding the nucleus It behaves like nothing you have seen is one simplication at least Electrons behave in this respect in exactly the same way as photons they are both screwy but in exactly in the same way The difficulty really is psychological and exists in the perpetual torment that results from your saying to yourself But how can it be like that which is reflection of uncontrolled but utterly vain desire to see it in terms of something familiar will not describe it in terms of an analogy with something familiar will simply describe it There was time when the newspapers said that only twelve men understood the theory of relativity do not believe there ever was such time There might have been time when only one man did because he was the only guy who caught on before he wrote his paper But after people read the paper lot of people understood the theory of relativity in some way or other certainly more than twelve On the other hand think can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics So do not take the lecture too seriously feeling that you really have to understand in terms of some model what am going to describe but just relax and enjoy it am going to tell you what nature behaves like If you will simply admit that maybe she does behave like this you will find her delightful entrancing thing Do not keep saying to yourself if you can possible avoid it But how can it be like that because you will get down the drain into blind alley from which nobody has escaped Nobody knows how it can be like you like the solution change the problem العلم دقيق أما الفن فصادق انظر إلى لوحة لوجه إنسان أو منظر طبيعي كم هما صادقان إن فيهما من الصدق أكثر مما في أي صورة فوتوغرافية للوجة But it seems to me to be an imperfection in things of beauty and weakness in man if an explanation from the has destructive effect The horror which we feel for interpretations is entirely due to our own barbaric or childish naivete which believes that there can be heights without corresponding depths and which blinds us to the really final truth that when carried to extremes opposites main objects of all science the freedom and happiness of man are the sole objects of all legitimate government plaque with this quotation with the first phrase omitted is in the

ultimately matter of feeling or rather of desire to know or the desire to when having boring interview on the telephone and trying to think about something else because the questions are too boring

day of the week to make dent in what like to learn about things pretty depressing You know we have little bits of understanding glimpses little bit of light here and there but tremendous amount of darkness which is challenge think life would be pretty boring if we understood everything better if we understand anything and know that we the important stubborn critic would say What is the benefit of these sciences He does not know the virtue that distinguishes mankind from all the animals it is knowledge in general which is pursued solely by man and which is pursued for the sake of knowledge itself because its acquisition is truly delightful and is unlike the pleasures desirable from other pursuits For the good cannot be brought forth and evil cannot be avoided except by knowledge What benefit then is more vivid What use is more abundant We all have thirst for wonder deeply human quality Science and religion are both bound up with it What saying is you have to make stories up you have to exaggerate wonder and awe enough in the real world lot better at inventing wonders than we have artists with no scientific knowledge and scientists with noartistic knowledge and both with no spiritual sense of gravity at all and the result is not just bad it is most telling and profound way of describing the evolution of the universe would undoubtedly be to trace the evolution of the abstract it might be tempting to imagine that irreducible complexity simply requires multiple simultaneous mutations that evolution might be far chancier than we thought but still possible Such an appeal to brute luck can never be refuted Luck is metaphysical speculation scientific explanations invoke can cosmic religious feeling be communicated from one person to another if it can give rise to no definite notion of God and no theology In my view it is the most important function of art and science to awaken this feeling and keep it alive in those who are receptive to is the poetry of reality By our destiny is to become like the gods we once worshipped and feared But our tools will not be magic wands and potions but the science of computers nanotechnology artificial intelligence

carried us to the gateway to the universe And yet our conception of our surroundings remains the disproportionate view of the child We are spiritually and culturally paralyzed unable to face the vastness to embrace our lack of centrality and find our actual place in the fabric of nature We batter this planet as if we had someplace else to go That we even do science is hopeful glimmer of mental health However not enough merely to accept these insights intellectually while we cling to spiritual ideology that is not only rootless in nature but also in many ways contemptuous of what is

the desire to make this point line to give it direction The directions in which it can be sent the uses to which it can be put by culturally professionally and geographically diverse society are almost without limit The possibilities make good scientists as putative science The significance of language for the evolution of culture lies in this that mankind set up in language separate world beside the other world place it took to be so firmly set that standing upon it it could lift the rest of the world off its hinges and make itself master of it To the extent that man has for long ages believed in the concepts and names of things as in aeternae veritates he has appropriated to himself that pride by which he raised himself above the animal he really thought that in language he possessed knowledge of the world The sculptor of language was not so modest as to believe that he was only giving things designations he conceived rather that with words he was expressing supreame knowledge of things language is in fact the first stage of occupation with science Here too it is the belief that the truth has been found out of which the mightiest sources of energy have flowed great deal later only now it dawns on men that in their belief in language they have propagated tremendous error Happily it is too late for the evolution of reason which depends on this belief to be put back Logic too depends on presuppositions with which nothing in the real world corresponds for example on the presupposition that there are identical things that the same thing is identical at different points of time but this science came into existence through the opposite belief that such conditions do obtain in the real world It is the same with mathematics which would certainly not have come into existence if one had known from the beginning that there was in nature no exactly straight line no real circle no absolute else gets under your skin keeps you working days and nights at

To be the first vessel to hold this new of the scientists known have at least one more quality in common they do what they do because they love it and because they cannot imagine doing anything else In sense this is the real reason scientist does science Because the scientist must Such compulsion is both blessing and burden blessing because the creative life in any endeavor is gift filled with beauty and not given to everyone burden because the call is unrelenting and can drown out the rest of mixed blessing and burden must be why the astrophysicist continued working until his mid why visitor to apartment in found the young physicist rocking his infant with one hand while doing mathematical calculations with the other This mixed blessing and burden must have been the sweet hell that referred to when he realized at young age that he was destined to be poet Never more he wrote shall escape believe that math and nature respond to democracy Just because very clever people have rejected the role of the infinite their collective opinions however weighty persuade mother nature to alter her ways Nature is never wrong quantum mechanics the physics of our world requires that you hold such pedestrian complaints in sheer quantity of brain power that hurled itself voluntarily and quixotically into the search for new baseball knowledge was either exhilarating or depressing depending on how you felt about baseball The same intellectual resources might have cured the common cold or put man on has made us gods even before we are worthy of being worth anything is permanently bound to desk or laboratory but the charming notion that true science can only be based on unbiased observation of nature in the raw is mythology Creative work in geology and anywhere else

emotional and physical pain the muscles around the lachrymal glands receive message from the brain then tighten and squeeze out tears Tears contain high levels of the hormone and prolactin endorphins

for the basic carwash and they gone ahead and detailed her wanted to say we didn order this But of course said nothing Death makes us helplessly of the advantages of science is that work ultimately is either replicated or it is amazing to me that we humans have the intellectual capacity to ask deep questions and to devise methods for learning how the universe works and how its contents evolve with

turkeys are the bit like sympathetic magic in way the usual presumption that primitive rituals mimic what they desire to phallic objects might be believed to increase male potency and playacting rainfall might somehow bring it about am suspicious of such obvious connections and suspect that the connections among things people and processes can be equally irrational sense the world might be more dreamlike metaphorical and poetic than we currently just as irrational as sympathetic magic when looked at in typically scientific way be surprised if in the broadest sense in the sense of world filled with metaphor rhyme and recurring patterns shapes and how the world works The world logical just about blowing things up Rather about blowing things up and knowing how you did fossil is buried with its birth certificate That and the scarcity of fossils means that it is effectively impossible to link fossils into chains of cause and effect in any valid way To take line of fossils and claim that they represent lineage is not scientific hypothesis that can be tested but an assertion that carries the same validity as bedtime story amusing perhaps even instructive but not live in world where unfortunately the distinction between true and false appears to become increasingly blurred by manipulation of facts by exploitation of uncritical minds and by the pollution of the true mentor in life is science comfortable with the unknown the point of science There are places out there billions of places out there that we know nothing about And the fact that we know nothing about them excites me and want to go out and find out about what science think if you re not comfortable with the unknown then it difficult to be scientist don need an answer don need answers to everything want to have answers to we have the courage to recognize cruelty for what it is we cannot expect things to be much better in this world We cannot have peace among men whose hearts delight in killing any living creature By every act that glorifies or even tolerates such moronic delight in killing we set back the progress of through world every day more stultified which expected salvation in codes and governments ever more willing to settle for suburban narratives and diminished were the chances of finding anyone else seeking to transcend that and not even particularly aware of it All over the world there are enormous numbers of smart even gifted people who harbor passion for science But that passion is unrequited suggest that some percent of are scientifically is the playground of dull is of great advantage to the student of any subject to read the original memoirs on that subject for science is always most completely assimilated when it is in the nascent state was reading about animals while back and there was this motherfucking scientist in back in the thirties or forties or whenever the motherfuck it was and he was trying to get apes to draw these pictures to make art pictures like the kinds of pictures in serious motherfucking paintings that you see in museums and shit So the scientist keeps showing the apes these paintings and giving them charcoal pencils to draw with and then one day one of the apes finally draws something but it not the art pictures that it draws What it draws is the bars of its own motherfucking cage Its own motherfucking cage Man the truth it May God us Single vision and all the occurrences possible in the universe the priori probability of any particular one of them verges upon zero Yet the universe exists particular events must take place in it the probability of which before the event was infinitesimal At the present time we have no legitimate grounds for either asserting or denying that life got off to but single start on earth and that as consequence before it appeared its chances of occurring were next to nil Destiny is written concurrently with the event not prior to it The universe was not pregnant with life nor the biosphere with man Our number came up in the game Is it surprising that like the person who has just made million at the casino we should feel strange and little unreal All things remarkable are

Then you get the wrong answer and you go to the Moon that way Nature person you trick them into believing something else if you try to tell the Moon made of cheese you can argue for days and it change the Moon What talking about is rationalization like starting with sheet of paper moving straight down to the bottom line using ink to write and therefore the Moon is made of cheese and then moving back up to write all sorts of clever arguments above But either the Moon is made of cheese or it The moment you wrote the bottom line it was already true or already false Whether or not the whole sheet of paper ends up with the right conclusion or the wrong conclusion is fixed the instant you write down the bottom the frontier of science once was is now the apex of mathematical achievement occurs when two or more fields which were thought to be entirely unrelated turn out to be closely intertwined Mathematicians have never decided whether they should feel excited or upset by such was long before could believe that human learning had no clear answer to this question For long time it seemed to me as listened to the gravity and seriousness wherewith Science affirmed its positions on matters unconnected with the problem of life that must have misunderstood something For long time was timid in the presence in learning and fancied that the insufficiency of the answers which received was not its fault but was owing to my own gross ignorance but this thing was not joke or pastime with me but the business of my life and was at last forced to the conclusion that these questions of mine were the only legitimate questions underlying all knowledge and that it was not that was in fault in putting them but science in pretending to have an answer for the birth of printing books became widespread Hence everyone throughout devoted himself to the study of literature Every year especially since the number of writings published in every field is greater than all those produced in the past thousand years The have created medicine anew and the have created astronomy anew really believe that at last the world is alive indeed seething and that the stimuli of these remarkable

cylindrical three times as wide as it is deep and only the upper part is inhabited But this Earth is isolated in space and the sky is complete sphere in the center of which is located unsupported our cylinder the Earth situated at an equal distance from all the points of the anyone who is practically acquainted with scientific work is aware that those who refuse to go beyond fact rarely get as far as fact and anyone who has studied the history of science knows that almost every great step therein has been made by the anticipation of Nature that is by the invention of hypotheses which though verifiable often had very little foundation to start of it said doctor whose acquaintance made at the start of this book no engineer could design something as multifunctional and fine tuned as an anus to call someone an asshole is really bragging him day hundreds of observations and experiments pour into the hopper of the scientific literature Many of them have much to do with evolution observations about the details of physiology biochemistry development and so on but many of them do And every fact that has something to do with evolution confirms its truth Every fossil that we find every molecule that we sequence every organ system that we dissect supports the idea that species evolved from common ancestors innumerable possible observations that could prove evolution untrue we have single one We find mammals in rocks humans in the same layers as dinosaurs or any other fossils out of evolutionary order sequencing supports the evolutionary relationships of species originally deduced from the fossil record And as natural selection predicts we find no species with adaptations that only benefit different species We do find dead genes and vestigial organs incomprehensible under the idea of special creation million chances to be wrong evolution always comes up right That is as close as we can get to scientific the dawn of exact knowledge to the present day observation experiment and speculation have gone hand in hand and whenever science has halted or strayed from the right path it has been either because its votaries have been content with mere unverified or unverifiable speculation and this is the commonest case because observation and experiment are hard work while speculation is amusing or it has been because the accumulation of details of observation has for time excluded distinct substances which concretes generally either afford or are made up of may without very much inconvenience be called the elements or principles of matter how beautiful your theory is If it agree with experiment these two years have been gravitating towards your doctrines and since the publication of your primula paper with accelerated velocity By about this time next year expect to have shot past you and to find you pitching into me for being more than yourself However you have set me going and must just take the consequences for warn you will stop at no point so long as clear reasoning will take me further Letter of support to on his theory of evolution Quite often when an idea that could be helpful presents itself we do not appreciate it for it is so inconspicuous The expert has perhaps no more ideas than the inexperienced but appreciates more what he has and uses it doctors are like poor plumbers They treat splashing tube by cleaning up the water These plumbers are extremely apt at drying up the water constantly inventing new expensive and refined methods of drying up water Somebody should teach them how to close the we think for ourselves if unwilling to question authority then just putty in the hands of those in power But if the citizens are educated and form their own opinions then those in power work for us In every country we should be teaching our children the scientific method and the reasons for of Rights With it comes certain decency humility and community spirit In the world that we inhabit by virtue of being human this may be all that stands between us and the enveloping four stages of acceptance This is worthless nonsense This is an interesting but perverse point of view This is true but quite unimportant always said so Review of The Truth About Death in Journal of Genetics Science is the key to our future and if you don believe in science then you re holding everybody back And it fine if you as an adult want to run around pretending or claiming that you don believe in evolution but if we educate generation of people who don believe in science that recipe for disaster We talk about the That comes from science Weather forecasting That comes from science The main idea in all of biology is evolution To not teach it to our young people is child was aware that at night infrared vision would reveal monsters hiding in the bedroom closet only if they were But everybody knows that your average bedroom monster is reptilian and the very moment that humans discovered the scale of the universe and found that their most unconstrained fancies were in fact dwarfed by the true dimensions of even the Way Galaxy they took steps that ensured that their descendants would be unable to see the stars at all For million years humans had grown up with personal daily knowledge of the vault of heaven In the last few thousand years they began building and emigrating to the cities In the last few decades major fraction of the human population has abandoned rustic way of life As technology developed and the cities were polluted the nights became starless New generations grew to maturity wholly ignorant of the sky that had transfixed their ancestors and that had stimulated the modern age of science and technology Without even noticing just as astronomy entered golden age most people cut themselves off from the sky cosmic isolationism that ended only with the dawn of space faith that admires truth that strives to know God must be brave enough to accommodate the try not to think with my gut If serious about understanding the world thinking with anything besides my brain as tempting as that might be is likely to get me into trouble maintain that the cosmic religious feeling is the strongest and noblest motive for scientific research think science is hard to teach because humans ready for it or because it arose only through fluke or because by and large we have the brainpower to grapple with it Instead the enormous zest for science that see in and the lesson from the remnant both speak eloquently proclivity for science is embedded deeply within us in all times places and cultures It has been the means for our survival It is our birthright When through indifference inattention incompetence or fear of skepticism we discourage children from science we are disenfranchising them taking from them the tools needed to manage their bodies become luminous when heated Their luminosity disappears after some time but the capacity of becoming luminous afresh through heat is restored to them by the action of spark and also by the action of was little had this science book There was section on What would happen to the world if there was no friction Answer Everything on earth would fly into space from the centrifugal force of revolution That was my in the intellectual pursuits of science or in the mystical pursuits of the spirit the light beckons ahead and the purpose surging in our nature the who doubt the fact of evolution are ignorant of biology those who think the world began less than ten thousand years ago are worse than ignorant they are deluded to the point of perversity They are denying not only the facts of biology but those of physics geology cosmology archaeology history and chemistry as have no need of this are many hypotheses in science which are wrong That perfectly all right it the aperture to finding out what right Science is it is not commonplace sir If up to now for example have been told to love my neighbor and did love him what came of it What came of it was that tore my caftan in two shared it with my neighbor and we were both left half naked in accordance with the proverb which says If you chase several hares at once you overtake any one of them But science says Love yourself before all because everything in the world is based on If you love only yourself you will set your affairs up properly and your caftan will also remain in one piece And economic truth adds that the more properly arranged personal affairs and so to speak whole caftans there are in society the firmer its foundations are and the better arranged its common cause It follows that by acquiring for everyone as it were and working so that my neighbor will have something more than torn caftan not from private isolated generosities now but as result of universal who thinks cryptozoology is the study of the impossible has never really taken very good look at the natural world Once you get past the megamouth sharks naked mole rats and spotted hyenas then the basilisks dragons and cuckoos just seem that unreasonable yes but unreasonable Not mutations much more easily debilitate genes than improve them and that this is true even of the helpful mutations Let me emphasize our experience with malaria effects on humans arguably our most highly studied genetic system shows that most helpful mutations degrade genes What more as group the mutations are incoherent meaning that they are not adding up to some new system They are just small changes mostly degradative in unrelated genes The lesson is that this is certainly not the kind of process we would expect to build the astonishingly elegant machinery of the cell If random mutation plus selective pressure substantially trashes the human genome why should we think that it would be constructive force in the long term There is no reason to think prediction can make with the highest confidence is that the most amazing discoveries will be the ones we are not today wise enough to spend months barely acknowledging existence and then emotionally addicted to her Science would probably blame it on chemicals genetics or something equally logical but it feel like anything History Of The Universe In Three CHAPTER is the team trying to go to the moon If you put someone up please put them cannot separate passion from pathology any more than you can separate spirit from his is needed more than truth and in relation to it everything else has only value This unconditional will to truth what is it Is it the will not to allow oneself to be deceived Or is it the will not to deceive For the will to truth could be interpreted in the second way too if only the special case do not want to deceive myself is subsumed under the generalization do not want to deceive But why not deceive But why not allow oneself to be deceived Note that the reasons for the former principle belong to an altogether different realm from those for the second One does not want to allow oneself to be deceived because one assumes that it is harmful dangerous calamitous to be deceived In this sense science would be prudence caution utility but one could object in all fairness How is that Is wanting not to allow oneself to be deceived really less harmful less dangerous less calamitous What do you know in advance of the character of existence to be able to decide whether the greater advantage is on the side of the unconditionally mistrustful or of the unconditionally trusting For the scientist at exactly the moment of discovery that most unstable existential moment the external

repose felt was in the presence of yogis deep in meditation or hermits deep in prayer wise beings whose intense imaginative lives were beyond the reach of scientific savant doit ordonner on fait la science avec des faits comme une maison avec des pierres mais une accumulation de faits pas plus une science tas de pierres une Scientist must set in order Science is built up with facts as house is with stones But collection of facts is no more science than heap of stones is have not the reverent feeling for the rainbow that the savage has because we know how it is made We have lost as much as we gained by prying into that and scholars represent the opposite extremes The scholar struggles for the benefit of all humanity sometimes to reduce physical effort sometimes to reduce pain and sometimes to postpone death or at least render it more bearable In contrast the patriot sacrifices rather substantial part of humanity for the sake of his own prestige His statue is always erected on pedestal of ruins and corpses In contrast all humanity crowns scholar love forms the pedestal of his statues and his triumphs defy the desecration of time and the judgment of suffering has been caused because too many of us cannot grasp that words are only tools for our mere presence in the dictionary of word like living does not mean it necessarily has to refer to something definite in the real is science It simply fancier term for showing people the impossible is global culture is kind of arrogant newcomer It arrives on the planetary stage following four and half billion years of other acts and after looking about for few thousand years declares itself in possession of eternal truths But in world that is changing as fast as ours this is prescription for disaster No nation no religion no economic system no body of knowledge is likely to have all the answers for our survival There must be many social systems that would work far better than any now in existence In the scientific tradition our task is to find yet we knew for certainty that when first emissaries of Earth went walking among the planets other sons would be dreaming not about such expeditions but about piece of you have only ever experienced privilege equality feels like right in suggesting that ordinary life is mean between these extremes that the noble man devotes his material wealth to lofty ends the advancement of science or art or some such true ideal and that the base man does the opposite by concentrating all his abilities on the amassing of wealth Exactly that is the real distinction between the artist and the bourgeois or if you prefer it between the gentleman and the cad Money and the things money can buy have no value for there is no question of creation but only of exchange Houses lands gold jewels even existing works of art may be tossed about from one hand to another they are so constantly But neither you nor can write sonnet and what we have our appreciation of art we did not buy We inherited the germ of it and we developed it by the sweat of our brows The possession of money helped us but only by giving us time and opportunity and the means of travel the principle is clear one must sacrifice the lower to the higher and as the did with their oxen one must fatten and bedeck the lower so that it may be the worthier highest court is in the end one own conscience and conviction that goes for you and for and every other physicist and before any science there is first of all is good principle in science not to believe any well it fits into some accepted frame of reference of course an observation can shatter the frame and force the construction of new one but that is extremely rare and seldom appear more than once per century which is just as well for the equanimity of the monkeys came down from the trees and learned to hurl sharp objects they had had to move into caves for only from the big predatory cats but as they began to lose their monkey fur from the elements Eventually they started transposing their hunting fantasies onto cave walls in the form of pictures first as an attempt at practical magic and later for the strange unexpected pleasure they discovered in artistic creation Time passed Art came off the walls and turned into ritual Ritual became religion Religion spawned science Science led to big business And big business if it continues on its present mindless voracious trajectory could land those of us lucky enough to survive its ultimate legacy back into caves least can do is speak out for the hundreds of chimpanzees

the realization and humanization of God the transformation and dissolution of theology into our consciousness there lies the cold and alien world of actual things Between the two stretches the narrow borderland of the senses No communication between the two worlds is possible excepting across the narrow strip For proper understanding of ourselves and of the world it is of the highest importance

Scientific People unscientific mind why are we dividing the world which could shine Between religion and science all what matters is human are like potential energy the compliments of name on paper in documents word of mouth but faith is like kinetic energy the motion and the force that which is witnessed Hence in the end it is the faith rather than the credentials that really takes you places happen to know this and happen to know that and maybe know that and work everything out from there Tomorrow may forgot that this is true but remember that something else is true so can reconstruct it

often Be happy want to pause here and talk about this notion of consensus and the rise of what has been called consensus science regard consensus science as an extremely pernicious development that ought to be stopped cold in its tracks Historically the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels it is way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other reach for your wallet because being be clear the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus Consensus is the business of politics Science on the contrary requires only one investigator who happens to be right which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world In science consensus is irrelevant What is relevant is reproducible results The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the is no such thing as consensus science If consensus it science If science it consensus you can be scientist if you re uncomfortable with ignorance because scientists live at the boundary between what is known and unknown in the cosmos This is very different from the way journalists portray us So many articles begin Scientists now have to go back to the drawing moment several things are possible the next moment only one happens and the rest exist Except that other worlds have sprung into being on which the did am become death the destroyer of worlds quoting the after witnessing the first Nuclear explosion would suggest that science is at least in my part informed can call the spirits from the vasty Why so can or so can any man But will they come when you do call for them To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances for admitting different amounts of light and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration could have been formed by natural selection seems confess absurd in the highest degree The difficulty of believing that perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection though insuperable by our imagination should not be considered subversive of the was

me go to separate specialist there who will finish treating your left day and in every way am becoming better and better am not very impressed with theological arguments whatever they may be used to support Such arguments have often been found unsatisfactory in the past In the time of it was argued that the texts And the sun stood still and hasted not to go down about whole day and He laid the foundations of the earth that it should not move at any time cv were an adequate refutation of the theory have not yet lost feeling of wonder and of delight that this delicate motion should reside in all the things around us revealing itself only to him who looks for it remember in the winter of our first experiments just seven years ago looking on snow with new eyes There the snow lay around my doorstep great heaps of protons quietly precessing in the magnetic field To see the world for moment as something rich and strange is the private reward of many name is was the first born of the forges when mankind first began to experiment with iron rose from their imagination from their ambition to conquer the world with metal that could slice through bronze like paper was there when the world started to shift when humans took their first steps out of the Dark Ages into civilization For many years thought was alone But mankind is never satisfied Others came risen from these dreams of new world Then with the invention of computers the gremlins came and the bugs Given life by the fear of monsters lurking in machines these were more chaotic than the other fey violent and destructive They spread to every part of the world As technology became driving force in every country powerful new fey rose into existence And the most powerful of this all the ants on the planet taken together

for little over century yet it has brought about decline in almost every ecosystem on the planet Nature have design problem People way we think may be completely different but you and are an ancient archetypal couple the original man and woman We are the model for and For all couples in love there comes moment when man gazes at woman with the very same kind of realization It is an infinite helix the dance of two souls resonating like the twist of like the vast people who actually make the advances in theoretical physics think in these categories that the philosophers and the historians of science subsequently invent for be frustrating being scientist There you are incrementally discovering how the universe works via series of complex tests and experiments for the benefit of all mankind and what thanks do you get People call you egghead or boffin or heretic and they cave your face in with rock and bury you out in the wilderness Not literally not in this day and age but you get the idea Scientists are mistrusted by huge swathes of the general public who see them as emotionless rather than say fellow human beings actually bothered getting off their arses to work this shit out To naturalist nothing is indifferent the humble moss that creeps upon the stone is equally interesting as the lofty pine which so beautifully adorns the valley or the mountain but to naturalist who is reading in the face of the rocks the annals of former world the mossy covering which obstructs his view and renders indistinguishable the different species of stone is no less than serious subject of

physical strength explain how our species created civilization think there was always some scrawny dreamer sitting at the edge of the firelight who had the ability to imagine dangers to look into the future in his imagination and see possibilities and therefore survived to pass his genes on to the next generation When the big ape men ended up running off the cliff or getting killed while trying to beat mastodon into submission with stick the dreamer was standing back thinking that might work but you need to run the mastodon off the cliff And then mate with the women left over after the got elegance of mathematical theorem is directly proportional to the number of independent ideas one can see in the theorem and inversely proportional to the effort it takes to see attitude which the man in the street unconsciously adopts towards science is capricious and varied At one moment he scorns the scientist for highbrow at another anathematizes him for blasphemously undermining his religion but at the mention of name like he falls into coma of veneration When he stops to think he does recognize however that the whole atmosphere of the world in which he lives is tinged by science as is shown most immediately and strikingly by our modern conveniences and material resources little deeper thinking shows him that the influence of science goes much farther and colors the entire mental

advanced to the stage of conclusion of intelligent design flows naturally from the data itself not from sacred books or sectarian beliefs that biochemical systems were designed by an intelligent agent is humdrum process that requires no new principles of logic or science It comes simply from the hard work that biochemistry has done over the past forty years combined with consideration of the way in which we reach conclusions of design every fundamental claim of intelligent design is straightforward and easily intelligible namely there are natural systems that cannot be adequately explained in terms of undirected natural forces and that exhibit features which in any other circumstance we would attribute to would hardly think at first that horrid monsters lie up there waiting to be discovered by any moderately penetrating to which those of the oceans bear no sort of comparison What monsters may they be Impersonal monsters namely Until person has thought out the stars and their he has hardly learnt that there are things much more terrible than monsters of shape namely monsters of magnitude without known shape Such monsters are the voids and waste places of the sky In these

accept what our explorations tell us would not choose to live in any age but my own advances in medicine alone and the consequent survival of children with access to these benefits should preclude any temptation to trade for the past But we cannot understand history if we saddle the past with pejorative categories based on our bad habits for dividing continua into compartments of increasing worth

two things wear in exactly the same way No two things ever break in exactly the same essential fact which emerges is that the three smallest and most active reservoirs of carbon in the global carbon cycle the atmosphere the plants and the soil are all of roughly the same size This means that large human disturbance of any one of these reservoirs will have large effects on all three We cannot hope either to understand or to manage the carbon in the atmosphere unless we understand and manage the trees and the soil the time is ripe for certain things these things appear in different places in the manner of violets coming to light in early and time again throughout the history of medical practice what was once considered as scientific eventually becomes regarded as bad practice Faith and science have learned are two sides of the same coin separated by an expanse so small but wide enough that one side see the other They even know connected Father and were two sides of the same coin decided and maybe am the space in is much in this vision that will remind you of your mystics yet between them and us there is far more difference than similarity in respect both of the matter and the manner of our thought For while they are confident that the cosmos is perfect we are sure only that it is very beautiful While they pass to their conclusion without the aid of intellect we have used that staff every step of the way Thus even when in respect of conclusions we agree with your mystics rather than your plodding intellectuals in respect of method we applaud most your intellectuals for they scorned to deceive themselves with comfortable ask facts and religion ask faith humans are confused between life and death mind nothing happening in book but nothing happening in phony saying things people never say doing jobs that fit the whole simply asking too much of reader Something happening in phony way must beat nothing happening in phony way every time right mean you could prove that mathematically in an equation and you often apply science to atoms of the earth are formed inside of stars Nothing really dies everything is surpluses will have to be expended somehow and trust the oligarchs to find way Magnificent roads will be built There will be great achievements in science and especially in art When the oligarchs have completely mastered the people they will have time to spare for other things They will become worshippers of beauty They will become And under their direction and generously rewarded will toil the artists The result will be great art for no longer as up to yesterday will the artists pander to the bourgeois taste of the middle class It will be great art tell you and wonder cities will arise that will make tawdry and cheap the cities of old time And in these cities will the oligarchs dwell and worship fun to think that one day our great great grandchildren may get that much closer to understanding what the hell creation is doing here in the first place and glimpsing the underlying structure and nature of matter itself they live with the same existential horrors we all quietly face today in our own lives There is kind of bravery to our condition reckon brought into being without an explanation in potentially infinite and apparently dead universe and expected to just get on with it as though nothing strange is going on Well it fucking is And all right to have meltdown about the whole affair from time to time faced with the pressures of modern existence trying to be good human and good worker and good son daughter parent trying to be good citizen trying to be wise without condescension but uninhibited without recklessness trying to just muddle through without making any silly decisions trying to align with the correct political opinions trying to stay thin trying to be attractive trying to be smart trying to find the ideal partner trying to stay financially secure trying to just find some modest corner of meaning and belonging and sanity to go and sit in and all the while living on the edge of dying forever all in the same strange boat grappling with the same strange condition But it quite so scary if we all do it together So do it knows what the whales may have to click and clack about but it could be form of to stop here and synchronously dive down in search of deep water squid now time to resurface

queens Over the generations they have consistently voted in favor of enhanced male mass Their dream candidate nowadays is some fellow named and three times their time scientist publishes good piece of work she helps to maintain and raise the standards for what is true We have to keep chipping away imagine the scientists wanting me to walk into the lab and start fiddling around with some big bowl of electrons they had we reject science we reject the common is no greater power than the one others do not believe you aim of science is to make difficult things understandable in simpler way the aim of poetry is to state simple things in an incomprehensible way The two are use was time to those soon achieve Immortality It took less than an hour to make the atoms few hundred million years to make the stars and planets but five billion years to make man The smaller the creature the bolder its has to awaken to wonder and so perhaps do peoples Science is way of sending him to sleep you know where your breakthrough begins Your breakthrough begins where your excuses read he is the master of us doesn always happen in burst of glory Sometimes small triumphs and large hearts change the course of history Sometimes chicken can save man you removed all the arteries veins capillaries from person body and tied them the person will the mapmaker who was the first man to accurately measure the size

science but ends at himself the complex of both intelligence and imagination On the other hand the survive without deity beyond himself to hunt He pretend he simply nullifies his own we consider the magnitude and extent of his discoveries and their influence on the progress of science and of industry there is no honour too great to pay to the memory of one of the greatest scientific discoverers of all music serves to convey feelings through the interaction of physical gestures and sound the musician needs his brain state to match the emotional state he is trying to express Although the studies been performed yet willing to bet that when King is playing the blues and when he is feeling the blues the neural signatures are very similar Of course there will be differences too and part of the scientific hurdle will be subtracting out the processes involved in issuing motor commands and listening to music versus just sitting on chair head in hands and feeling down And as listeners there is every reason to believe that some of our brain states will match those of the musicians we are listening understand something God didn create evil in the world but He did create free will which allowed for the possibility of evil Science isn like that What you explore and find God did create It already exists When you find it you are discovering something God made And everything God created is good God said so in He looked around at everything He had made and said It is very good There are two objectionable types of believers those who believe the and those who believe that belief must be discarded and replaced by the scientific method Between these two extremes there is enough scope for believing the reasonable and reasoning on sound do not fall in the face of like all men to the temptations of arrogance of which intellectual pride is the worst he the scientist must nevertheless remain sincere and modest if only because his studies constantly bring home to him that compared with the gigantic aims of science his own contribution no matter how important is only drop in the ocean of possible that the reason never experienced ghostly presence is that my temporal lobes wired for it It could well be that the main difference between skeptics notwithstanding and believers is the neural structure they were born with But the question still remains Are these people whose brains alert them to enough books focus on how culture responds to radically new ideas or discovery Especially in the biography genre they tend to focus on all the sordid details in the life of the person who made the discovery find this path to be voyeuristic but not enlightening Instead ask After evolution was discovered how did religion and society respond After cities were electrified how did daily life change After the airplane could fly from one country to another how did commerce or warfare change After we walked on the Moon how differently did we view Earth My larger understanding of people places and things derives primarily from stories surrounding questions such as intended me for the tranquil pursuits of science by rendering them my supreme delight But the enormities of the times in which have lived have forced me to take part in resisting them and to commit myself on the boisterous ocean of political simplest strategy for bouts of noxious flatus is to not care Or perhaps to take advantage of gastroenterologist know get dog To blame But as has well pointed out truth is more likely to come out of error if this is clear and definite than out of confusion and my experience teaches me that it is better to hold and intelligible opinion even if it should turn out to be wrong than to be content with mixture of conflicting views sometimes miscalled impartiality and often no better than no opinion at it be possible at some future time when neurophysiology has advanced substantially to reconstruct the memories or insight of someone long

certainly passed through several stars and been part of millions of organisms on its way to becoming you We are each so atomically numerous and so vigorously recycled at death that significant number of our atoms up to billion for each of us it has been suggested probably once belonged to billion more each came from and and and any other historical figure you care to name The personages have to be historical apparently as it takes the atoms some decades to become thoroughly redistributed however much you may wish it you are not yet one with So we are all reincarnations though ones When we die our atoms will disassemble and move off to find new uses elsewhere as part of leaf or other human being or drop of dew Atoms however go on practically you stumble at mere believability what are you

entire human species through the oceans of space and make deliberate falsification for personal gain is the last worst depth to which either scholar or artist can descend in work or life Letter to St have been accused of habit of changing my opinions am not myself in any degree ashamed of having changed my opinions What physicist who was already active in would dream of boasting that his opinions had not changed during the last half century In science men change their opinions when new knowledge becomes available but philosophy in the minds of many is assimilated rather to theology than to science The kind of philosophy that value and have endeavoured to pursue is scientific in the sense that there is some definite knowledge to be obtained and that new discoveries can make the admission of former error inevitable to any candid mind For what have said whether early or late do not claim the kind of truth which theologians claim for their creeds claim only at best that the opinion expressed was sensible one to hold at the time when it was expressed should be much surprised if subsequent research did not show that it needed to be modified hope therefore that whoever uses this dictionary will not suppose the remarks which it quotes to be intended as pontifical pronouncements but only as the best could do at the time towards the promotion of clear and accurate thinking Clarity above all has been my we are merely matter intricately assembled is this really demeaning If nothing here but atoms does that make us less or does that make matter more While the principle comes with no guarantees that it will forever guide us to cosmic truths worked quite well so far not only is Earth not in the center of the solar system but the solar system is not in the center of the Way galaxy the Way galaxy is not in the center of the universe and it may come to pass that our universe is just one of many that comprise multiverse And in case one of those people who thinks that the edge may be special place we are not at the edge of anything choses sont infinies et la bêtise humaine Mais en ce qui concerne je en ai pas encore acquis la certitude neural processes underlying that which we call creativity have nothing to do with rationality That is to say if we look at how the brain generates creativity we will see that it is not rational process at all creativity is not born out of reasoning frequently asked Do you believe extraterrestrial intelligence give the standard arguments there are lot of places out there the molecules of life are everywhere use the word billions and so on Then say it would be astonishing to me if there extraterrestrial intelligence but of course there is as yet no compelling evidence for asked next What do you really think say just told you what really think Yes but your gut feeling But try not to think with my gut If serious about understanding the world thinking with anything besides my brain as tempting as that might be is likely to get me into trouble Really okay to reserve judgment until the evidence is put it bluntly but fairly anyone today who doubts that the variety of life on this planet was produced by process of evolution is simply ignorant inexcusably ignorant in world where three out of four people have learned to read and her deafness the auditory part of the brain deprived of its usual input had started to generate spontaneous activity of its own and this took the form of musical hallucinations mostly musical memories from her earlier life The brain needed to stay incessantly active and

with mortgages and stock portfolios who think people are walking around grocery stores with dinosaurs in their we credit God with designing man it turns out not sufficiently skilled to have done so In point of fact He unintentionally knocked over the first domino by creating palette of atoms with different shapes Electron clouds bonded molecules bloomed proteins embraced and eventually cells formed and learned how to hang on to one another like lovebirds He discovered that by simmering the Earth at the proper distance from the Sun it instinctively sprouted with life not so much creator as molecule tinkerer who enjoyed stroke of luck He simply set the ball rolling by creating smorgasbord of matter and creation knowledge and investigation help promote wonder they do not destroy it Whatever our tastes we can generally appreciate such things as music art or wine better when we understand bit about them We read up on our favourite singers or artists because we feel we can appreciate their work better when we know how they think and what they bring to their work The giddy delight and curiosity that comes from marvelling at the beauty of this universe is deepened not cheapened by the laws and facts science gives us to aid our understanding In similar way the psychological tricks at work behind many seemingly paranormal events are truly more fascinating than the explanation of precisely because they are of this world and say something about how rich and complex and mysterious we are as human beings to be convinced by such trickery indeed to want to perpetuate it in the first in science fiction flicks always seemed to know useful things about the places time travel took them But what if the time traveler had been only an average history student What then Let us fool ourselves no longer At the very moment nations threw off the ancient regime of absolute government operating under king they were restoring this same system in far more effective form in their technology reintroducing coercions of military character no less strict in the organization of factory than in that of the new drilled uniformed and regimented army During the transitional stages of the last two centuries the ultimate tendency of this system might in doubt for in many areas there were strong democratic reactions but with the knitting together of scientific ideology itself liberated from theological restrictions or humanistic purposes authoritarian technics found an instrument at hand that as now given it absolute command of physical energies of cosmic dimensions The inventors of nuclear bombs space rockets and computers are the pyramid builders of our own age psychologically inflated by similar myth of unqualified power boasting through their science of their increasing omnipotence if not omniscience moved by obsessions and compulsions no less irrational than those of earlier absolute systems particularly the notion that the system itself must be expanded at whatever eventual co st to mechanization automation cybernetic direction this authoritarian technics has at last successfully overcome its most serious weakness its original dependence upon resistant sometimes actively disobedient servomechanisms still human enough to harbor purposes that do not always coincide with those of the the earliest form of authoritarian technics this new technology is marvellously dynamic and productive its power in every form tends to increase without limits in quantities that defy assimilation and defeat control whether we are thinking of the output of scientific knowledge or of industrial assembly lines To maximize energy speed or automation without reference to the complex conditions that sustain organic life have become ends in themselves As with the earliest forms of authoritarian technics the weight of effort if one is to judge by national budgets is toward absolute instruments of destruction designed for absolutely irrational purposes whose chief would be the mutilation or extermination of the human race Even and performed their gory operations under normal human center of authority in this new system is no longer visible personality an king even in totalitarian dictatorships the center now lies in the system itself invisible but omnipresent all its human components even the technical and managerial elite even the sacred priesthood of science who alone have access to the secret knowledge by means of which total control is now swiftly being effected are themselves trapped by the very perfection of the organization they have invented Like the of the Pyramid Age these servants of the system identify its goods with their own kind of as with the divine king their praise of the system is an act of and again like the king they are in the grip of an irrational compulsion to extend their means of control and expand the scope of their authority In this new collective this of power there is no visible presence who issues commands unlike God the new deities cannot be confronted still less defied Under the pretext of saving labor the ultimate end of this technics is to displace life or rather to transfer the attributes of life to the machine and the mechanical collective allowing only so much of the organism to remain as may be controlled and nothing like the discovery of an unknown work by great thinker to set the intellectual community atwitter and cause academics to dart about like those things one sees when looking at drop of water under is no problem more difficult to solve than that created by slang for the rectum is prison wallet Give me the positions and velocities of all the particles in the universe and will predict the can believe in the future and work to achieve it and preserve it or we can whirl blindly on behaving as if one day there will be no children to inherit our legacy The choice is ours the earth is in need to invent way to make work like in are clever man friend you reason well and your wit is bold but you are too prejudiced You do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to you Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand and yet which are that some people see things that others cannot But there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men eyes because they know or think they know some things which other men have told them it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all and if it explain not then it says there is nothing to explain But yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs which think themselves new and which are yet but the old which pretend to be young like the fine ladies at the opera Today the invisible hand seems confused and indecisive Ideology and rhetoric increasingly guide policy decision often bearing little relationship to factual reality And the we once knew seems divided and angry defiantly embracing is made up not of great sacrifices or duties but of little things in which smiles and kindness and small obligations given habitually are what preserve the heart and secure the we be sure that they are incapable of the feelings or sentiments that are believed to place them on lower scale than humans Do we deny sensitivity to all of the lower orders to blunt protect and ultimately deny our own We will see that bees can grieve over teh loss of queen sound war cries or hum with contentment they can be angry docile ferocious playful aggressive appear happy or utter pitiful sounds of distress are these not emotions akin to ours merely expressed differently Si el universo fuese un vestido cuál te pondrías esta noche In essence what relativity says is that space and time are not absolute but relative both to the observer and the thing being observed and the faster one moves the more pronounced these effects will become We can never accelerate ourselves to the speed of light and the harder we try the faster we go the more distorted we become relative to an outside disappears again and we rise up off the floor like spooks from grave like the in here every thirty are slowly waking up to an inconvenient truth the universe looks suspiciously like fix The issue concerns the very laws of nature themselves For years physicists and cosmologists have been quietly collecting examples of all too convenient coincidences and special features in the underlying laws of the universe that seem to be necessary in order for life and hence conscious beings to exist Change any one of them and the consequences would be lethal the distinguished cosmologist once said it was as if has monkeyed with physics To see the problem imagine playing God with the cosmos Before you is designer machine that lets you tinker with the basics of physics Twiddle this knob and you make all electrons bit lighter twiddle that one and you make gravity bit stronger and so on It happens that you need to set thirtysomething knobs to fully describe the world about us The crucial point is that some of those metaphorical knobs must be tuned very precisely or the universe would be neutrons are just tad heavier than protons If it were the other way around atoms exist because all the protons in the universe would have decayed into neutrons shortly after the big bang No protons then no atomic nucleuses and no atoms No atoms no chemistry no life Like Baby porridge in the story of the universe seems to be just right for marvelous cooperative arrangement plants and animals each inhaling each exhalations kind of mutual resuscitation the entire elegant cycle powered by star million kilometers is not heartless pursuit of objective information it is creative human is only word for whose acquaintance with scientific research is derived chiefly from its practical results easily develop completely false notion of the mentality of the men who surrounded by skeptical world have shown the way to kindred spirits scattered wide through the world and through the centuries Only one who has devoted his life to similar ends can have vivid realization of what has inspired these men and given them the strength to remain true to their purpose in spite of countless failures It is cosmic religious feeling that gives man such strength contemporary has said not unjustly that in this materialistic age of ours the serious scientific workers are the only profoundly religious life Life itself Was it perhaps only an infection sickening of matter Was that which one might call the original procreation of matter only disease growth produced by morbid stimulation of the immaterial The first step toward evil toward desire and death was taken precisely then when there took place that first increase in the density of the spiritual that pathologically luxuriant morbid growth produced by the irritant of some unknown infiltration this in part pleasurable in part motion of was the primeval stage of matter the transition from the insubstantial to the substance This was the is federal system of sadistic torture vivisection and animal genocide which has been carried on for decades under the fraudulent guise of respectable medical research And nobody on the outside knows or wants to know or is willing to find out My parents my friends my teachers wouldnt listen to me or suggested that if it was bothering me that much just had to quit the job Just like that As if that would have solved anything As if could ever live with such cowardice You imagine or maybe you can how many people are convinced without knowing the first thing about it Animal research is essential have been hopelessly brainwashed on this issue The animal rights people by and large acknowledge the essential futility of trying to change the system So they address the smaller issues fighting for legislation which would provide one extra visit per week to the labs by custodian of the US dept of agriculture Or demanding that squirrel monkey be given an extra square inches in his holding pen before being led to the slaughter That sort of thing For whomever and whatever worth hope my little write up is clear dont have the guts to do whats necessary pray someone out there who does God help all of advantage of the emotions is that they lead us astray and the advantage of science is that it is not be able to see into friends dream is dream in itself Doctor Some information is classified legitimately as with military hardware secrecy sometimes really is in the national interest Further military political and intelligence communities tend to value secrecy for its own sake way of silencing critics and evading responsibility for incompetence or worse It generates an elite band of brothers in whom the national confidence can be reliably vested unlike the great mass of citizenry on whose behalf the information is presumably made secret in the first place With few exceptions secrecy is deeply incompatible with democracy and with fascination with computer models is something understand very well called it disease fear he is right Hold your tongue or kill you The devil kill me No excuse me will speak came to treat myself to that pleasure Oh love the dreams of my ardent young friends quivering with eagerness for life There are new men you decided last spring when you were meaning to come here they propose to destroy everything and begin with cannibalism Stupid fellows they ask my advice maintain that nothing need be destroyed that we only need to destroy the idea of God in man how we have to set to work that that we must begin with Oh blind race of men who have no understanding As soon as men have all of them denied God and believe that period analogous with geological periods will come to pass the old conception of the universe will fall of itself without cannibalism and more the old morality and everything will begin anew Men will unite to take from life all it can give but only for joy and happiness in the present world Man will be lifted up with spirit of divine pride and the will appear From hour to hour extending his conquest of nature infinitely by his will and his science man will feel such lofty joy from hour to hour in doing it that it will make up for all his old dreams of the joys of heaven Everyone will know that he is mortal and will accept death proudly and serenely like god His pride will teach him that useless for him to repine at being moment and he will love his brother without need of reward Love will be sufficient only for moment of life but the very consciousness of its momentariness will intensify its fire which now is dissipated in dreams of eternal love beyond the grave and so on and so on in the same style Charming sat with his eyes on the floor and his hands pressed to his ears but he began trembling all over The voice continued The devil The question now is my young thinker reflected is it possible that such period will ever come If it does everything is determined and humanity is settled for ever But as owing to inveterate stupidity this cannot come about for at least thousand years everyone who recognises the truth even now may legitimately order his life as he pleases on the new principles In that sense all things are lawful for him more even if this period never comes to pass since there is anyway no God and no immortality the new man may well become the even if he is the only one in the whole world and promoted to his new position he may lightheartedly overstep all the barriers of the old morality of the old slaveman if necessary There is no law for God Where God stands the place is holy Where stand will be at once the foremost place all things are lawful and the end of it all very charming but if you want to swindle why do you want moral sanction for doing it But our modern all over He bring himself to swindle without moral sanction He is so in love with truth Many textbooks point out that no animal has evolved wheels and cite the fact as an example of how evolution is often incapable of finding the optimal solution to an engineering problem But it is not good example at all Even if nature could have evolved moose on wheels it surely would have opted not to Wheels are good only in world with roads and rails They bog down in any terrain that is soft slippery steep or uneven Legs are better Wheels have to roll along an unbroken supporting ridge but legs can be placed on series of separate footholds an extreme example being ladder Legs can also be placed to minimize lurching and to step over obstacles Even today when it seems as if the world has become parking lot only about half of the land is accessible to vehicles with wheels or tracks but most of the land is accessible to vehicles with feet animals the vehicles designed by natural the conclusion that the universe was designed and that the design extends deeply into life science philosophy religion or what In sense it hardly matters By far the most important question is not what category we place it in but whether conclusion is true true philosophical or religious conclusion is no less true than true scientific one Although universities might divide their faculty and courses into academic categories reality is not obliged to respect such boundaries يا طير هجت الطائرينا فتنت لب العالمينالله درك ساحرا أبطلت كيد الساحريناأظهرت معجزة العلوم لنا كنا كافريناإنا لقوم يعشقون النابغين الباسلينايتسابقون حفاوة بالأقربين seems that scientific research reaches deeper and deeper But it also seems that more and more people at least scientists are beginning to realize that the spiritual factor is important say spiritual without meaning any particular religion or faith just simple warmhearted compassion human affection and gentleness It is as if such warmhearted people are bit more humble little bit more content consider spiritual values primary and religion secondary As see it the various religions strengthen these basic human qualities As practitioner of my practice of compassion and my practice of are actually one and the same But the practice of compassion does not require religious devotion or religious faith it can be independent from the practice of religion Therefore the ultimate source of happiness for human society very much depends on the human spirit on spiritual values If we do not combine science and these basic human values then scientific knowledge may sometimes create troubles even disaster have come with this message since our gods and our aspirations are no longer anything but scientific why our loves be so too peneliti adalah mengungkap rahasia dengan printer paper and imagine bird shaped something like football with legs standing on it Imagine of these

students the evidence for and against is not the same as teaching intelligent design The has officially endorsed teaching students the full range of scientific views about space is relative There is no such thing as size The telescope and the microscope have produced deadly leveling of great and small far and near The only little thing is sin the only great thing is fear The Genetics might be adequate for explaining microevolution but microevolutionary changes in gene frequency were not seen as able to turn reptile into mammal or to convert fish into an amphibian Microevolution looks at adaptations that concern the survival of the fittest not the arrival of the fittest The origin of species problem remains almost as if each instant is our last and first We are always dying and always reborn And that is living need to travel back in time to cause trouble Seeing back through time finds me trouble enough the ongoing suspicion that scientific discoveries or rigorous biblical scholarship will undermine faith is tacit admission that faith is threatened by knowledge because it is ultimately constructed on weak or faulty assumptions and like the proverbial house of cards needs to be protected from collapsing It is true that neither the ancient wisdoms nor the modern sciences are complete in themselves They do not stand alone They call for one another Wisdom without science is unable to penetrate the full sapiential meaning of the created and the material cosmos Science without wisdom leaves man enslaved to world of unrelated objects in which there is no way of discovering or creating order and deep significance in own pointless existence The idea that one can go to the fossil record and expect to empirically recover an sequence be it of species genera families or whatever has been and continues to be pernicious of point of view quite easy to see that is not in the same league as the hard sciences For instance will often compare their theory favorably to physics claiming that is just as well established as general relativity Yet how many physicists while arguing for the truth of physics will claim that general relativity is as well established as theory scientist He never cried He flips through image searches of burn victims while he touches Light and Knowledge are Intangible and most dangerous worldview is the worldview of those have not viewed the only were science and religion compatible they were rise of science was achieved by deeply religious scholars It ever been the way of the man of science or philosophy Most folks stay in the dark and then complain they can see nothing evolution is not religious tenet to which one swears allegiance or belief as matter of faith It is factual reality of the empirical world

God is perfect his handiwork functions in accord with immutable principles By the full use of our powers of reason and observation it ought to be possible to discover these principles These were the crucial ideas that explain why science arose in and no where YOU WANT TO CREATE CHANGE you must challenge not only the models of but the paradigms that underwrite could not be successful scientist without realizing that in contrast to the popular conception supported by newspapers and mothers of scientists goodly number of scientists are not only and dull but also just about the accredited and orderly facts of every science there ever floats sort of of exceptional observations of occurrences minute and irregular and seldom met with which it always proves more easy to ignore than to attend to Anyone will renovate his science who will steadily look after the irregular phenomena and when science is renewed its new formulas often have more of the voice of the exceptions in them than of

explicación necia que no explica nada pues es tan difícil imaginar la eternidad suya como la de la materia es la vuelta del bobo lo postulamos para entender cuanto no entendemos pero sin entenderlo At this point in history our society tends to elevate and reward the specialist This concentrated focus has brought some benefits It may also be modern malady when taken too far and allowed to define who and what we are becomes limiting It robs us of our wholeness and our It misses the big picture and confines us to narrow zoom And it leaves us at the mercy of three creative prototypes the scientist the artist and the saint know instinctively without the help of any mere philosopher that each must obey an absolute rule of conduct Three words established and hallowed by usage express the divinities the values the supreme aims served respectively by these three kinds of men with an undivided loyalty truth for the scientist beauty for the artist goodness for the saint The discussion on what these words mean will never end We must be content with taking note of their clarity as symbols and of the singular force which animates them and makes of them powerful poles of attraction placed

Torn by the storms of mysterious powers Evil contending with good from its birth in battle the heartstrings of earth what infinities circle us here and wonderment swathing the sphere In the new century science will defeat famine boredom and the plague but vital knowledge will become so elevated that nobody will know how anything works the good news is that everybody will be empowered the bad news is nobody will understand us accept the possibility that there is at death not an abrupt cessation of energy rather dispersal This seems more than reasonable to me Mind you owned series of old cars and used to turning off the motor only to experience series of rumblings and explosions that would shame many volcano This is the sort of thing conceptualizing kind of clunky And just as some cars are more susceptible to this behavior so people vary in the length of time and the force with which their energy sputters and gasps My example is overly dramatic but it is not wholly unreasonable and it serves to make this genetic mutation player at the evolutionary table You see what getting at biologically and evolutionally sound model for the soul say achieved it conceive of the soul as an aura that human beings wear on their backs cumberson as carapace Some are larger than way to eliminate the harm caused by stereotypes is to teach our children to recognize false stereotypes to be empathetic and to be skeptical We need to promote these skills in addition to instilling the best values we know Skepticism the heart of the scientific method is the only way we know how to ferret out fact from genetics calculations suggest that in million years one million years longer than the alleged time between and animals with generation lines of about ten years typical of whales could substitute no more than about mutations This is not nearly enough to generate the new information that whales need for aquatic life even assuming that all the hypothetical mutations required for this could somehow arise And as shown in chapter real science shows that this cannot occur As man gradually advanced in intellectual power and was enabled to trace the more remote consequences of his actions as he acquired sufficient knowledge to reject baneful customs and superstitions as he regarded more and more not only the welfare but the happiness of his as from habit following on beneficial experience instruction and example his sympathies became more tender and widely diffused extending to men of all races to the imbecile maimed and other useless members of society and finally to the lower animals so would the standard of his morality rise higher and you can appreciate science and religion at the same time your life must be cosmos is full beyond measure of elegant truths of

mastery No longer imprisoned in the wordlessness of the trauma she discovers that there is language for her experience She discovers that she is not alone others have suffered in similar ways She discovers further that she is not crazy the traumatic syndromes are normal human responses to extreme circumstances And she discovers finally that she is not doomed to suffer this condition indefinitely she can expect to recover as others have recovered The plural of anecdote is not still try for who knows what is possible Creating better creativity in the that science has helped us to overcome the awe of the unknown in nature we are the slaves of social pressures of our own making When called upon to act independently we cry for patterns systems and authorities If by enlightenment and intellectual progress we mean the freeing of man from superstitious belief in evil forces in demons and fairies in blind short the emancipation from denunciation of what is currently called reason is the greatest service reason can kind shared this world for but blink then sadly they became enlightened found science and religion The new world of men left little room for magic or the magical creatures of old Earth first children were driven into the shadows by flame and cold iron by man insatiable need of by science mean first of all worldview giving primacy to reason and observation and methodology aimed at acquiring accurate knowledge of the natural and social world This methodology is characterized above all else by the critical spirit namely the commitment to the incessant testing of assertions through observations and or experiments the more stringent the tests the better and to revising or discarding those theories that fail the test One corollary of the critical spirit is fallibilism namely the understanding that all our empirical knowledge is tentative incomplete and open to revision in the light of new evidence or cogent new arguments though of course the most aspects of scientific knowledge are unlikely to be discarded entirely stress that my use of the term science is not limited to the natural sciences but includes investigations aimed at acquiring accurate knowledge of factual matters relating to any aspect of the world by using rational empirical methods analogous to those employed in the natural sciences Please note the limitation to questions of fact intentionally exclude from my purview questions of ethics aesthetics ultimate purpose and so forth Thus science as use the term is routinely practiced not only by physicists chemists and biologists but also by historians detectives plumbers and indeed all human beings in some aspects of our daily lives Of course the fact that we all practice science from time to time does not mean that we all practice it equally well or that we practice it equally well in all areas of our lives We all have an unscientific weakness for being always in the right and this weakness seems to be particularly common among professional and amateur politicians But the only way to apply something like scientific method in politics is to proceed on the assumption that there can be no political move which has no drawbacks no undesirable consequences To look out for these mistakes to find them to bring them into the open to analyse them and to learn from them this is what scientific politician as well as political scientist must do Scientific method in politics means that the great art of convincing ourselves that we have not made any mistakes of ignoring them of hiding them and of blaming others from them is replaced by the greater art of accepting the responsibility for them of trying to learn from them and of applying this knowledge so that we may avoid them in the rise of classical the soul debate evolved into the more familiar the liver having been demoted to an accessory role We are fortunate that this is so for we would otherwise have been faced with singing My

crutch to be is vacuous answer To say that God made the world is simply more or less sophisticated way of saying that we understand how the universe originated god in so far as it is anything is an admission of ignorance Religion utterly failed to provide an explanation of the biosphere other than that God made it all Then thundered over the horizon and in few decades of observation and thought arrived at an answer regard teaching religion as purveying lies came here today to you all am quite sure that our views on evolution would be very different had biologists studied genetics and natural

how it can stop dislike this whole business of experimentation on animals unless some very good and altogether exceptional reason to this very case The thing that gets me is that not possible for the animals to understand why they are being called upon to suffer They suffer for their own good or benefit at all and often wonder how far for given no choice and there is no central authority responsible for deciding whether done is morally justifiable These experiment animals are just sentient objects useful because they are able to react sometimes precisely because able to feel fear and pain And used as if they were electric light bulbs or boots What it comes to is that whereas there used to be human and animal slaves now there are just animal slaves They have no legal rights or

false spent millions of dollars inventing the pen so they could write in space The took of the most fussy science teacher you ever had The one who docked your grade if the sixth decimal place in your answer was rounded incorrectly who tucked in his periodic table corrected every student who said weight when he or she meant mass and made everyone including himself wear goggles even while mixing sugar water Now try to imagine someone whom your teacher would hate for being That is the kind of person who works for bureau of standards and measurement Doubt is not new idea this is the idea of the age of reason This is the philosophy that guided the men who made the democracy that we live under The idea that no one really knew how to run government led to the idea that we should arrange system by which new ideas could be developed tried out and tossed out if necessary with more new ideas bought in system This method was result of the fact that science was already showing itself to be successful venture at the end of the eighteenth century Even then it was clear to socially minded people that the openness of possibilities was an opportunity and that doubt and discussion were essential to progress into the unknown If we want to solve problem that we have never solved before we must leave the door to the unknown ajar doubt is not to be feared but welcomed and are two kinds of truth The truth that lights the way and the truth that warms the heart The first of these is science and the second is the universe does consist of battle between the devil and God the final analysis should conclude that religion would have been the devil most brilliant move and science God means nothing but an unusually obstinate effort to think clearly The fundamental conceptions of psychology are practically very clear to us but theoretically they are very confused and one easily makes the obscurest assumptions in this science without realizing until challenged what internal difficulties they main reason for scepticism about the theory is that the human brain is demonstrably eager to see faces in random patterns as we know from scientific evidence on top of the numerous legends about faces of or the Virgin or Mother being seen on slices of toast or pizzas or patches of damp on wall This eagerness is enhanced if the pattern departs from randomness in the specific direction of being are as much matter of questions as asked whether or not we are our position is the same as that of physicist when asked if he is where memory is located in the brain is like asking where running is located in the body There are certainly parts of the body that are more important the legs or less important the little fingers in performing the task of running but in the end it is an activity that requires complex coordination among great many body parts and muscle groups To extend the analogy looking for differences between memory systems is like looking for differences between running and walking There certainly are many differences but the main difference is that running requires more coordination among the different body parts and can be disrupted by small things such as corn on the toe that may not interfere with walking at all Are we to conclude then that running is located in the corn on your toe All what we think and know is an illusion Nothing exists Everything is an is it so difficult for us to think in relative terms Well for the good reason that human nature loves absoluteness and erroneously considers it as state of higher college in the early 1950s began to learn little about how science works the secrets of its great success how rigorous the standards of evidence must be if we are really to know something is true how many false starts and dead ends have plagued human thinking how our biases can colour our interpretation of evidence and how often belief systems widely held and supported by the political religious and academic hierarchies turn out to be not just slightly in error but grotesquely just how time travel looks like to the untrained eye The reason why there more travelers is that your average physicist refuses to be eaten by giraffe in the name of science Chemist found one other necessary requirement for full initiation into science Belief If science has become the orthodoxy of the individuals are nevertheless still free to take it or leave it in whole or in part believers in astrology and virgin birth abound But no one can become scientist unless he presumes that the scientific doctrine and method are fundamentally sound and that their ultimate premises can be unquestionably best ship the best culture the best knowledge is the one which allows us to go farther explore more territories or oceans of

kind of brain surgery Just as war is too important to leave it to the generals science and technology are too important to leave in the hands of the true life really is generous to those who pursue their Personal account of science which does not explicitly describe it as something we believe in is essentially incomplete and false pretense It amounts to claim that science is essentially different from and superior to all human beliefs that are not scientific this is untrue remember one bobcat they had in here now bobcats are an endangered species in this neck of the woods caught it somewhere and they must have put that cat through dozen rounds of burn experiments before they finally determined that it was utterly useless to them Like an empty beer can And then you know what they did to it was late for lunch date so rather thanput the destroyed but still breathing animal to sleep he picked it up by its hind legs and simply smashed its head against wall repeatedly until it was

hate hatred that was consummated in me which is as dangerous hormone or chemical or portion of the brain as any neutron bomb Except that didnt know how to explode was like computer without keyboard

on things to get hold of ourselves to steer safe course and meteorology now explain what only few centuries ago was considered sufficient cause to burn women to beings viewed as behaving systems are quite simple The apparent complexity of our behavior over time is largely reflection of the complexity of the environment in which we find is my territory but science fiction is the landscape of my dreams would remind you to notice where the claim of consensus is invoked Consensus is invoked only in situations where the science is not solid enough Nobody says the consensus of scientists agrees that mc2 Nobody says the consensus is that the sun is million miles away It would never occur to anyone to speak that way scientist may not be sure of the answer but often sure he can find one And condition which is clearly not enjoyed by humble humilis never hurt creation necessarily ends in this Creators powerless fleeing from the things they have seek the lawfulness of events It is the task of Religion to fit man into this most essential prediction of is that given an astronomical number of chances unintelligent processes can make systems ones of the complexity of those found in the cell specifically denies this predicting that in the absence of intelligent input no such systems would develop So and make clear opposite predictions of what we should find when we examine genetic results from stupendous number of organisms that are under relentless pressure from natural selection The recent genetic results are stringent test The results prediction is falsified Design prediction is conclusion is not poetically balanced it cannot be scientifically is essentially an anarchic enterprise theoretical anarchism is more humanitarian and more likely to encourage progress than its the statistical gargon used in psychology refers to the probability that the difference you see between two groups of introverts and extroverts say or males and females could have occurred by chance As general rule psychologists report difference between two groups as significant if the probability that it could have occurred by chance is in or less The possibility of getting significant results by chance is problem in any area of research but particularly acute for sex differences research for example neuroscientist interested in what parts of the brain are involved in mind reading You get fifteen participants into scanner and ask them to guess the emotion of people in photographs Since you have both males and females in your group you rin quick check to ensure that the two groups brains respond in the same way They do What do you do next Most likely you publish your results without mentioning gender at all in your report except to note the number of male and female participants What you do is publish your findings with the title No Sex Differences in Neural Circuitry Involved in Understanding Others Minds This is perfectly reasonable After all you looking for gender difference and there were only small numbers of each sex in your study But remember that even if males and females overall respond the same way on task five percent of studies investigating this question will throw up significant difference between the sexes by chance As has explained sex is easily assessed routinely evaluated and not always reported Because it is more interesting to find difference than to find no difference the failures to observe difference between men and women go unreported whereas the in finding of difference is likely to be published This contributes to the phenomenon whereby studies that do find sex differences get published but those that languish unpublished and unseen in file is much that science understand many mysteries still to be resolved In Universe tens of billions of across and some ten or fifteen billion years old this may be the case forever We are constantly stumbling on new controversy between and intelligent design has the characteristics of major scientific revolutions in the past are losing power because they treat with contempt the very people on whom they depend the most taxpayers The outcome of this scientific revolution will be decided by young people who have the courage to question dogmatism and follow the evidence wherever it intelligent design people just nincompoops with degrees trying to sell creationism to cretinous public No need to address their concerns or respond to their arguments They are Not Science They are There just saved you the trouble of reading percent of the responses to the position This is how losers act just before they lose arrogant too important to be bothered with substantive refutation and disdainful of their own faults The only remaining question is whether will exit gracefully or whether it will go down biting screaming censoring and denouncing to the bitter end Central contributor that focus on human interactions morals that focus on relationship to Creator fall short of these things learned They fail to encompass the big message so far of century and half of biology and ecology life is more than anything else process it creates and depends on relationships among energy land water air time and various living things not just about interaction not just about spiritual interaction about all interaction bound with the rest of life in network network including not just all living things but the energy and nonliving matter that flows through the living making and keeping all of us alive as we make it alive We can keep debating ideologies and sending entreaties toward heaven But unless we embrace the fuller reality in and implications face big problems guess all or most of us the wards of that science which denied existence to anything it could not measure or explain The things we explain went right on but surely not with our blessing We did not see what we explain and meanwhile great part of the world was abandoned to children insane people fools and mystics who were more interested in what is than in why it is So many old and lovely things are stored in the attic because we want them around us and we dare throw them one disputes that seeming order can come out of the application of simple rules But who wrote the rules no obvious reason to assume that the very same rare properties that allow for our existence would also provide the best overall setting to make discoveries about the world around us We think this is merely coincidental It cries out for another explanation an explanation that points to purpose and intelligent design in the explaining an event we must choose from three competing modes of explanation These are regularity chance and design To attribute an event to design is to say that it cannot reasonably be referred to either regularity or long as scepticism is based on sound understanding of science it is invaluable for that is how science progresses But poor criticism can lead those who are unfamiliar with the science involved into doubting everything about climate change are opposed to mentioning scientific problems with their view you would think they would be even more opposed to mentioning intelligent design Yet have been discussing in public school science classes for years Biology textbooks have been mentioning intelligent design since the late 1990s but only to misrepresent and disparage its quest to discover how the patterns of reality are organised the story of modern science hints at picture of set of puzzle boxes each one more intricately structured and wondrous than the last Every time the final box appears to have been reached key has been found which has opened up another revealing new universe even more breathtakingly improbable in its conception We are now forced to suspect that for human reason there is no last box that in some deeply mysterious virtually unfathomable way every time we open still smaller box we are actually being brought closer to the box with which we started the box which contains our own conscious experience of the world This is why no theory of knowledge no epistemology can ever escape being consumed by its own paradoxes And this is why we must consider the universe to be irredeemably mystical am serving the purpose for which was designed therefore am satisfied with my existence if truth be told evolution hasn yielded many practical or commercial benefits Yes bacteria evolve drug resistance and yes we must take countermeasures but beyond that there is not much to say Evolution cannot help us predict what new vaccines to manufacture because microbes evolve unpredictably But hasn evolution helped guide animal and plant breeding Not very much Most improvement in crop plants and animals occurred long before we knew anything about evolution and came about by people following the genetic principle of like begets like Even now as its practitioners admit the field of quantitative genetics has been of little value in helping improve varieties Future advances will almost certainly come from transgenics which is not based on evolution at all review of The Evolving World Evolution in Everyday Life

without can we find spiritual meaning in scientific worldview Spirituality is way of being in the world sense of one place in the cosmos relationship to that which extends beyond oneself Does scientific explanation of the world diminish its spiritual beauty think not Science and spirituality are complementary not conflicting additive not detractive Anything that generates sense of awe may be source of spirituality Science does this in spades And if by the end of this book you reckon you might still disagree with me then offer you this still be wrong but be wrong with lot more panache

posthuman that embraces the possibilities of information technologies without being seduced by fantasies of unlimited power and disembodied immortality that recognizes and celebrates finitude as condition of human being and that understands human life is embedded in material world of great complexity one on which we depend for our continued aspirations of democracy are based on the notion of an informed citizenry capable of making wise decisions The choices we are asked to make become increasingly complex They require the thinking and greater tolerance for ambiguity that science fosters The new economy is predicated on continuous pipeline of scientific and technological innovation It can not exist without workers and consumers who are mathematically and scientifically literate since the order of the world is shaped by death it be better for God if we refuse to believe in Him and struggle with all our might against death without raising our eyes towards the heaven where He sits in silence More profoundly simplification may be seen in the universal prestige today accorded the lowest order of knowledge the scientific as well as the simplistic ideas of men like and which underlie virtually the whole of contemporary thought and say life for it is important to see that the history of our century has not been something imposed from without or above or at least has not been predominantly this it has rather presupposed and drawn its nourishment from soil that has long been preparing in the hearts of the people It is precisely from the of the commonplace from the everyday revealed in the life and thought and aspiration of the people that all the terrible events of our century have sprung The of is very instructive in this regard for in him the most extreme and monstrous rested upon the foundation of quite unexceptional and even typical He shared the common faith in science progress and enlightenment though not of course in democracy together with practical materialism that scorned all theology metaphysics and any thought or action concerned with any other world than the here and now priding himself on the fact that he had the gift of reducing all problems to their simplest foundations He had crude worship of efficiency and utility that freely tolerated birth control laughed at the institution of marriage as mere legalization of sexual impulse that should be free welcomed sterilization of the unfit despised unproductive elements such as monks saw nothing in the cremation of the dead but practical question and did not even hesitate to put the ashes or the skin and fat of the dead to productive use He possessed the distrust of sacred and venerable institutions in particular the Church with its superstitions and all its outmoded laws and ceremonies He had naive trust in the natural mom the healthy animal who scorns the in impede the natural functioning of the body He took delight in modern conveniences and machines and especially in the automobile and the sense of speed and freedom it is very little of this crude that is not shared to some degree by the multitudes today especially among the young who feel themselves enlightened and liberated very little that is not typically we are seeking to serve the God of truth then we should really welcome truth from whatever source it comes We shouldn fear the truth Some of it will be from science obviously but by no means all of it It will sometimes by perplexing how this bit of truth relates to that bit of truth we know that within science itself often enough and we find it outside of science as well The crucial thing is to be important thing in science is not so much to obtain new facts as to discover new ways of thinking about you thought you were trying to find out more about it because gonna get an answer to some deep philosophical question you may be wrong It may be that you get an answer to that particular question by finding out more about the character of nature But my interest in science is to simply find out about the is an organized pursuit of is casual pursuit of keep it in element of chance in basic research is overrated Chance is lady who smiles only upon those few who know how to make her history of science is the saga of nature defying common we know of the Missing Link is that he is missing and he be missed all that was main purpose of

drawn myriad red herrings across the track but the true scientist refuses to be baffled by superficial appearances in detecting the secrets of Nature The vulgar herd catches at the gross apparent fact but the man of insight knows what lies on the surfaces does those scientists who take it seriously evolution has functioned more as philosophical belief system than as testable scientific hypothesis This function of the theory is think what lies behind many of the extreme statements that you have doubtless encountered from some scientists opposing any critical analysis of in the classroom It is also why many scientists make public statements about the theory that they would not defend privately to other scientists like true scientist very profound question on his science and he will besilent Ask true religious person very simple question on his religion and he will be is not collection of facts Nor is science something that happens in the laboratory Science happens in the head flight of imagination beyond the constraints of ordinary perception chapter The Virgin and the before you say this is all just think how far the human race has come in the past ten years If someone had told your parents for example that they would be able to carry their entire music library in their pocket would they have believed it Now we have phones that have more computing power than was used to send some of the first rockets into space We have electron microscopes that can see individual atoms We routinely cure diseases that only fifty years ago was fatal and the rate of change is increasing Today we are able to do what your parents would of dismissed as impossible and your grandparents nothing short of magical but still think that to the unprejudiced the fossil record of plants is in favor of special ideology and philosophy of which is sold by its adepts as scientific theoretical foundation of biology seriously hampers the development of science and hides from students the field real far the greatest danger of Artificial Intelligence is that people conclude too early that they understand are constantly being shaped by seemingly irrelevant stimuli subliminal information and internal forces we know thing you are famous it is hard to work on small problems This is what did in After information theory what do you do for an encore The great scientists often make this error They fail to continue to plant the little acorns from which the mighty oak trees grow They try to get the big thing right off And that the way things go So that is another reason why you find that when you get early recognition it seems to sterilize piously record In the beginning God but say In the beginning hydrogen But let us not forget that human love and compassion are equally deeply rooted in our primate heritage and in this sphere too our sensibilities are of higher order of magnitude than those of Knowledge adds manly to the Mind frees it from Prejudice and hard to build models of inflation that lead to multiverse It not impossible so think there still certainly research that needs to be done But most models of inflation do lead to multiverse and evidence for inflation will be pushing us in the direction of taking the idea of multiverse say we are playing God My answer is If we play God who will Science demands from man all his life If you had two lives that would not be

mysticism The splitting up of sugar into and alcohol is no more the effect of vital principle than the splitting up of cane sugar by invertase The history of this problem is instructive as it warns us against considering problems as beyond our reach because they have not yet found their novice runs the risk of failure without additional traits strong inclination toward originality taste for

great discovery of the action of galvanic currents on magnets had he stopped in his researches to consider in what manner they could possibly be turned to practical account and so we would not now be

investigations apparently quite useless in this narrow sense of the word which have led to the most valuable and his pupils have succeeded in causing the secretion of saliva in the dog by means of

the voice or expression of which we call our conscience which is the complete opposite of competitive selfish and aggressive instincts As said The moral sense affords the best and highest distinction between man and the lower at the same time there must never be the least hesitation in giving up position the moment it is shown to be untenable It is not going too far to say that the greatness of scientific investigator does not rest on the fact of his having never made mistake but rather on his readiness to admit that he has done so whenever the contrary evidence is cogent semua orang bisa

on the threshold of brave new world It is an exciting if precarious place to be and we are the we invented fire we messed up repeatedly then invented the fire extinguisher With more powerful technologies such as nuclear weapons synthetic biology and strong artificial intelligence we should instead plan ahead and aim to get things right the first time because it may be the only chance we will get Our future is race between the growing power of our technology and the wisdom with which we use it Let make sure that wisdom it be possible to solve these problems It is certain that nobody has thus far observed the transformation of dead into living matter and for this reason we cannot form definite plan for the solution of this problem of transformation But we see that plants and animals during their growth continually transform dead into living matter and that the chemical processes in living matter do not differ in principle from those in dead matter There is therefore no reason to predict that abiogenesis is impossible and believe that it can only help science if the younger investigators realize that experimental abiogenesis is the goal of amino acids can only be made where there is no free oxygen in the atmosphere and porphyrins can only be made when there is free oxygen then these things needed by every cell could not have existed together to form the first cell What more many of these compounds are antagonistic They will combine and destroy each other anywhere except within living having begun to build their of without us they will end in anthropophagy And it is then that the beast will come crawling to us and lick our feet and spatter them with tears of blood from its eyes And we shall sit upon the beast and raise the cup and on it will be written Mystery If the business of physics is ever finished the world will be much less interesting place in which to live The more ignorant we become the less value we set on science and the less inclination we shall have to seek it often considered whether there could perhaps be found more reasonable arrangement of born as mediocre is fate but to die as one is the truth is just mere thought dismissed in his address religion as myth man who wants the truth becomes scientist man who wants to give free play to his subjectivity may become writer but what should man do who wants something in between Generally in life knowledge is acquired to be used But school learning more often fits apt metaphor knowledge is treated like money to be put away in bank for the be explained by some general biological work seems to confirm my old axiom it is useless to try to keep the whole body standpoint that description is impossible reject limine Physics does not consist only of atomic research science does not consist only of physics and life does not consist only of science The aim of atomic research is to fit our empirical knowledge concerning it into our other thinking All of this other thinking so far as it concerns the outer world is active in space and time If it cannot be fitted into space and time then it fails in its whole aim and one does not know what purpose it really But Keep oLd One iS Other is in the early 1970s we were not birdwatching We were birding and that made all the difference We were out to seek to discover to chase to learn to find as many different kinds of birds as possible and in friendly competition to try to find more of them than the next birder We became community of birders with the complications that human societies always have and although it was the birds that had brought us together our story became human story after was during my enchanted days of travel that the idea came to me which through the years has come into my thoughts again and again and always happily the idea that geology is the music of the earth started studying law but this could stand just for one semester stand more Then studied languages and literature for two years After two years passed an examination with the result have teaching certificate for and for the lower classes of the gymnasium for kids from to never made use of this teaching certificate And then came to philosophy physics and mathematics In fact came to mathematics indirectly was really more interested in physics and philosophy and thought about those It is little shortened but not quite wrong to say thought am not good enough for physics and am too good for philosophy Mathematics is in between am not however militant in my atheism The great theoretical physicist is militant atheist suppose he is interested in arguing about the existence of God am not It was once quipped that there is no God and is his prophet On the practical applications of particle physics research with the Large Sometimes the public says in it for Am going to get better television reception Am going to get better reception Well in some sense yeah All the wonders of quantum physics were learned basically from looking at technology But let me let you in on secret We physicists are not driven to do this because of better color television We do this because we want to understand our role and our place in

صوفية وأن يستبدل الحقيقة العلمية بعقائد جامدة والفاعلية الإجتماعية بطقوس لابد أن يصطدم بالعلم والدين الصحيح على عكس هذا فهو متسق مع العلم وكثير من العلماء الكبار يسود عندهم الإعتراف بنوع من الوحدانية وفوق هذا يستطيع العلم أن يساعدالدين في محاربة المعتقدات الخرافية فإذا إنفصلا يرتكس الدين في التخلف ويتجه العلم نخو الإلحاد When we say two bodies touch what we mean without knowing it is that both electromagnetic fields are interacting to avoid physical interpenetration and that happens well before subatomic particles touch It is curious that the human mind could blindly accept an infinite speed but had reservations to accept finite one simply because it was too large إن التقدم العلمي مهما كان لا يمكنه أن يجعل الأخلاق والدين غير ضروريين فالعلم لا يعلم الناس كيف يحيون ولا من شأنه أن يقدم لنا معايير قيمية ذلك لأن القيم التي تسمو بالحياة الحيوانية إلى مستوى الحياة الإنسانية تبقى مجهولة وغير مفهومة بدون الدين فالدين مدخل إلى عالم أخر متفوق على هذا العالم والأخلاق هي معناه If superstition could contradict science the world may as well be on the back of turtle But giving into turtle worship was bridge too have studied incessantly under all its aspects question which was already in my mind since confess that my scheme is still mere dream and do not shut my eyes to the fact that so long as alone believe it to be possible it is virtually impossible The scheme in question is the cutting of canal through the of This has been thought of from the earliest historical times and for that very reason is looked upon as impracticable dictionaries inform us indeed that the project would have been executed long ago but for insurmountable obstacles On his inspiration for the Canal If and when all the laws governing physical phenomena are finally discovered and all the empirical constants occurring in these laws are finally expressed through the four independent basic constants we will be able to say that physical science has reached its end that no excitement is left in further explorations and that all that remains to physicist is either tedious work on minor details or the study and adoration of the magnificence of the completed system At that stage physical science will enter from the epoch of and into the epoch of the National Magazine While he attends to his rats gives me the lowdown on the haunt theory Why would certain type of electromagnetic field

had an von who was able to scan the scientific knowledge of his time in its details and to bring it within one vast generalization At the present juncture it is obviously very doubtful whether this task could be accomplished in similar way even by mind with gifts so peculiarly suited for the purpose as was and if all his time and work were devoted to the this young daughter of medicine It is to these two discoveries by that we owe the exactness of modern astronomy This double service assures to their discoverer the most distinguished place after and above the greatest astronomers of all ages and all time we proceed to explain some conjectural law or theory by new conjectural theory of higher degree of universality we are discovering more about the world trying to penetrate deeper into its secrets And every time we succeed in falsifying theory of this kind we make an important new discovery For these falsifications are most important They teach us the unexpected and they reassure us that although our theories are made by ourselves although they are our own inventions they are none the less genuine assertions about the world for they can clash with something we never for moment that we are nothing but the product of billions of years of molecules coming together and ratcheting up through natural selection that we are composed only of highways of fluids and chemicals sliding along roadways within billions of dancing cells that trillions of synaptic conversations hum in parallel that this vast egglike fabric of circuitry runs algorithms undreamt of in modern science and that these neural programs give rise to our decision making loves desires fears and aspirations To me that understanding would be numinous experience better than anything ever proposed in holy often people speak of art and science as though they were two entirely different things with no interconnection An artist is emotional they think and uses only his intuition he sees all at once and has no need of reason scientist is cold they think and uses only his reason he argues carefully step by step and needs no imagination That is all wrong The true artist is quite rational as well as imaginative and knows what he is doing if he does not his art suffers The true scientist is quite imaginative as well as rational and sometimes leaps to solutions where reason can follow only slowly if he does not his science we look up at night and view the stars everything we see is shinning because of distant nuclear came the bodies of animals to be contrived with so much art and for what ends were their several parts Was the eye contrived without skill in and the ear without knowledge of sounds and these things being rightly dispatch does it not appear from phænomena that there is Being incorporeal living intelligent And you are made of hundred trillion cells We are each of us without dominion providence and final causes is nothing else but Fate and Nature Blind metaphysical necessity which is certainly the same always and everywhere could produce no variety of things All that diversity of natural things which we find suited to different times and places could arise from nothing but the ideas and will of Being necessarily is way to call the bluff of those who only pretend to knowledge It is bulwark against mysticism against superstition against religion misapplied to where it has no business course supernatural acts are what miracles are all about They are after all precisely those things that circumvent the laws of nature god who can create the laws of nature can presumably also circumvent them at will Although why they would have been circumvented so liberally thousands of years ago before the invention of modern communication instruments that could have recorded them and not today is still something to wonder atom you possess has almost certainly passed through several stars and been part of millions of organisms on its way to becoming you We are

scientific breakthroughs They happen when you are looking at something been working on for years and suddenly see connection you never noticed before or when looking for something else altogether Sometimes they even happen by accident they know you get scientific breakthrough just because you want one curious aspect of the theory of evolution is that everybody thinks he understands science

that designer is possible If on the other hand he believes that designer is possible then he can argue that the evidence is overwhelmingly against the actions of such designer but he cannot say that someone who offers evidence on the other side is doing something of fundamentally different kind All he can say about that person is that he is scientifically after birth the line unchanging runs And

songs are full of repetition nursery rhymes and the little chants and songs we use to teach young children have choruses and refrains We are attracted to repetition even as adults we want the stimulus and the reward again and again and in music we get it Perhaps therefore we should not be surprised should not complain if the balance sometimes shifts too far and our musical sensitivity becomes propensity to excessive simplification is indeed natural to the mind of man since it is only by abstraction and generalisation which necessarily imply the neglect of multitude of particulars that he can stretch his puny faculties so as to embrace minute portion of the illimitable vastness of the universe But if the propensity is natural and even inevitable it is nevertheless fraught with peril since it is apt to narrow and falsify our conception of any subject under investigation To correct it partially for to correct it wholly would require an infinite intelligence we must endeavour to broaden our views by taking account of wide range of facts and possibilities and when we have done so to the utmost of our power we must still remember that from the very nature of things our ideas fall immeasurably short of the reality informed ignorance provides the natural state of mind for research scientists at the frontiers of knowledge People who believe themselves ignorant of nothing have neither looked for nor stumbled upon the boundary between what is known and unknown in the me think the greatest achievements of science is to allow humanity to realize that our world is comprehensible Through science rational thinking we can understand how the universe we want to set out on the aruous search for the truth we must all summon up the courage to leave the lines along which we have thought until now and as the first step begin to doubt everything that we previously accepted as correct and true Can we still afford to close our eyes and stop up our ears because new ideas are supposed to be heretical and absurd The whole scientific process resembles biological evolution problem is like an ecological niche and theory is like gene or species which is being tested

of the researches that were going on in semantics and pragmatics believe that this effort has proven to be failure Though did indeed revolutionize the subject of linguistics it is not at all clear at
