uncommon in children compared to adults The prevalence  of  palpable  thyroid  nodules  in  children  ranges  from    to    Sporadic  welldifferentiated thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy in children accounting for  of pediatric cancers  in  the  prepubertal  age  group  and  up  to   of cancers in adolescents aged \\x93 year2 The most common indication for thyroid surgery in children varies among published studies but thyroidectomy for malignant conditions is rising38 Data in children throughout the  world  are  relatively  scarce  The  objective  of  this study was to analyze the clinical data and outcome of thyroid  surgery  in  a  large  series  of  children  treated  at a  single  center  at  King  Faisal  Specialist  Hospital  and Research Center KFSHRC in RiyadhPATIENT AND METHODS With the approval of the Institutional Review Board IRB at KFSHRC the medical records of all patients  years old and younger who underwent a thyroid surgery between    and    were  retrospectively  reviewed We elected to include patients up to the year  to ensure a reasonable followup period Patients for the study were identified by a search of the operating room log for all procedures involving the thyroid gland for the specified age groupDemographic  data  clinical  features  and  surgical outcomes  were  collected  Specific  data  that  were  obtained included age at operation gender family history presenting  symptoms  history  of  radiation  exposure presence of multiple endocrine neoplasia type  MEN   thyroid  function  test  presence  and  size  of  thyroid nodules by ultrasound presence of lymph nodes metastasis or distant metastasis fine needle aspiration FNA cytology  surgical  procedure  final  histopathology  and length of followup Outcomes analyzed were postoperative complications including transient or permanent hypocalcemia  transient  or  permanent  recurrent  laryngeal nerve paralysis wound infection and hematoma length of stay and radioactive iodine treatment and recurrences Thyroid procedures in this series included hemithyroidectomy  subtotal  total  and  completion  thyroidectomy Surgeries were performed by either an endocrine adult surgeon or a pediatric surgeon No intraoperative nerve monitoring was used Early in the series procedures were performed by adult endocrine surgeons but lately a combined approach was adopted where pediatric surgeons and adult endocrine surgeons collaborated in such cases  proceduresthe normal range in our laboratory regardless of symptoms Transient hypocalcemia was identified if it lasted for less than  months while permanent hypocalcemia was  considered  if  the  serum  calcium  level  remained below normal range and the patient continued on calcium  supplementation  after    months  of  the  surgery All patients with a family history of MEN  underwent genetic testing of the RET protooncogene to confirm the diagnosis All patients who underwent completion thyroidectomy  had  a  preoperative  and  postoperative vocal  cords  assessment  at  the  Otolaryngology  clinic Descriptive data were generated and comparisons were conducted using the t test for continuous data

had medullary thyroid cancer  so  did  not  receive  RAI  In  the  remaining  five cases  there was no clear data whether those patients received RAI before or only after a recurrence All local recurrences  underwent  resection  except  for  one  patient who was lost follow up There was no mortality in this study DISCUSSIONThe most common indication for thyroidectomy in this series was thyroid nodule which correlates with previously published reports in the pediatric population35 Children with thyroid nodules have an estimated fourfold  higher  risk  of  developing  thyroid  cancer  compared to adults910 The high incidence of malignancy in this series suggests children with a thyroid nodule should be carefully evaluatedFNA is a valuablemethod for preoperative evaluation of thyroid nodules However there are limitations on  the  routine  use  of  FNA  in  children  including  the need  for  sedation  sampling  errors  and  the  limited availability  of  experienced  cytopathologists11  Many previous studies reported high sensitivity and specificity of FNA in evaluating thyroid nodule in children1114 which correlate with our findingsOur data showed lymph node metastasis in  of  thyroid  cancer  cases  which  supports  the  notion that  children  with  thyroid  cancer  frequently  present with more extensive disease than adults Lymphnode involvement  at  diagnosis  is  seen  in    to    of children  compared  with    to    of  adults  with differentiated thyroid cancer1523 Because our hospital is the largest referral center in Saudi Arabia especially for oncology cases this may explain the large number of lymph node and distant metastasis In this cohortThe  most  common  complication  reported  after thyroidectomy in children is hypoparathyroidism with an incidence ranging between  to  which original PEDIATRIC THYROID SURGERYANN SAUDI MED  JULYAUGUST WWWANNSAUDIMEDNET 0ccorresponds with our results of  which are reported as hypocalcemia in Table    One study found that total thyroidectomy central and bilateral neck dissection Graves\\x99 disease and malignancy were  risk  factors  for  hypocalcemia  after  thyroid  surgery3 In this cohort postoperative hypocalcemia was noted more in malignant cases but it failed to reach statistical significance Moreover there was no significant difference between benign and malignant cases in  terms  of  mean  age  gender  distribution  recurrent laryngeal nerve injury or overall complications a finding that was reported previously26 Multiple studies in recent years have found an inverse relationship between surgeon volume and complication  rates2728  but  similar  data  in  the  pediatric population is lacking One study found that highvolume  endocrine  surgeons  have  better  outcomes  and shorter lengths of stay and lower costs after thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy in children compared to pediatric surgeons general surgeons or otolaryngologists29  Scheumann  and  colleagues  also  concluded that a collaborative approach between pediatric and endocrine surgeons would have better outcomes This has led other authors to suggest that a combined approach with endocrine and pediatric surgeons in addition to pediatric endocrinologists may optimize the care of children with surgical thyroid disease given the low number of pediatric patients4 Our data do not allow for comparisons of different approaches given the late adoption of the combined approach The  recurrence  rate  for  thyroid  cancer  in  children after  thyroidectomy  has  varied  widely  in  reported studies  ranging  from    to    while  it  was   in  this  cohort  Only  a  few  studies  explored  the predictors  of  recurrence  Lymph  node  involvement multiple nodules male gender younger age histologic subtype and advanced tumor stage were risk factors associated with recurrence17233033 In  this  study    of  patients  with  malignant  lesions received RAI Although there are conflicting data regarding  the  indications  of  postoperative  RAI  treatment in lowrisk patients the current recommendation is that lowrisk patients can be treated without RAI3436There are some limitations to this study The retrospective nature may affect the validity and quality of the data The small number of cases in some categories did not enable us to compare groups and explore predictors relative to these factors On the other hand this study adds to the scarce data on thyroid surgery in pediatric age group Malignancy is the commonest indication  for  thyroid  surgery  in  children  and  FNA  is highly  diagnostic  Hypocalcemia  and  recurrent  laryngeal nerve injury are significant complications Cancerrelated  death  is  extremely  rare  but  recurrence  is  not uncommon and a significant number of patients with malignant cases received RAI treatmentoriginal PEDIATRIC THYROID SURGERYANN SAUDI MED  JULYAUGUST WWWANNSAUDIMEDNET 0cREFERENCES  Trowbridge  FL
